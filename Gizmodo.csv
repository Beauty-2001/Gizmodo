5/12/2023,Fake Hair and a 'Fire Sword': These Are the 22 Weirdest Things People Left in Ubers in 2023,"Photo: JavierMartinRuiz (Shutterstock)

I’ve had the misfortune of leaving things behind in an Uber. A birthday present. My phone. My purse with the money to pay for my cat’s Christmas photoshoot. Yet, I have never left anything as strange as what the folks in Uber’s 2023 “Lost and Found Index” have left, including “a pin of Jesus holding a slice of pizza” and “a fire sword.” (Does anyone know what a fire sword is?)

Uber drivers apparently find a lot of things in their cars, so much that the company has been publishing its funny lost and found report for seven years now. The report features a list of the 10 most commonly forgotten items, which are about what you’d expect: clothing, phones, wallets, backpacks, and headphones. Uber also lists the 10 most “forgetful” cities, with Jacksonville, Florida, San Antonio, Texas, and Palm Springs, California taking the top three slots.

Yet, my favorite nugget in Uber’s report is by far its list of the 50 most unique items left behind in its driver’s cars, mainly because my mind delights in contemplating where on Earth people were taking these items or why they decided to travel with them.

From “Britney Spears’ fantasy perfume” to something called a “happy sauce,” people left some really weird things in Ubers in 2023. Click through to check out more of the weirdest 22 items and read Uber’s report for yourself here for more whacky nuggets of info from its lost and found index.",https://gizmodo.com/uber-lost-and-found-22-weirdest-things-forgot-in-2023-1850429384
5/11/2023,Biden's 'Disinfo Overlord' Sues Fox News for Defamation,"Photo: Leonard Zhukovsky (Shutterstock)

Fox News is once again under scrutiny for a lawsuit filed by former Biden administration disinformation chief Nina Jankowicz on Wednesday. Jankowicz claims Fox News hosts carried out a “malicious campaign of destruction” that continues to threaten her safety and harm her career.


Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is cited in the complaint for falsely telling viewers that Jankowicz aimed to censor Americans’ speech and that she had been fired from her position. The complaint claims Carlson, along with hosts Maria Bartiromo and Sean Hannity told viewers that Jankowicz’s job was “to silence anyone who criticizes the Biden administration,” and Carlson warned she would “get men with guns to tell you to shut up.”

The lawsuit says Fox News’ claims hindered Jankowicz’s ability to live a normal life and resulted in her resignation from her position with the Biden administration to escape the seemingly endless criticism. Jankowicz briefly headed the Disinformation Governance Board which was created to monitor false information that would affect the government’s health and safety efforts and disinformation campaigns from foreign agents to influence the U.S. elections, among others.

Jankowicz claimed in the suit that Fox News hosts mentioned her no less than 300 times in an eight-month period last year, calling her “unhinged” and a “Minister of Truth” in what appeared to reference George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984.” Fox News hosts also reportedly portrayed Jankowicz as a “disinfo overlord,” “disinformation czaress,” a “lunatic,” “useful idiot,” and claimed she was “illiterate” and has a “low IQ,” the lawsuit says.

Fox News and Jankowicz’s attorney did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.

“This has had an immense impact for my family. I don’t think our security will ever be the same,” Jankowicz told The New York Times. “I want to make the point that this sort of disinformation and hate campaign doesn’t have a place in American media or American politics; that this isn’t what we stand for.”

Jankowicz’s lawsuit references the Dominion case against Fox News which similarly claimed the news outlet had intentionally spread misinformation—in that case, about the validity of its voting systems. The company reached a $787.5 million settlement with Fox News, marking an important step in holding news outlets accountable, Jankowicz said in the lawsuit.

Jankowicz’s attorney, Rylee Sommers-Flanagan, told The Times that the Dominion case “signals that there is a path” for defamation lawsuits against the network. “Dominion shows us how egregious the internal conversations that are happening at Fox are; it shows us that Fox News has an absolute disregard for truth when it is related to their ratings.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Jankowicz is demanding a trial by jury and compensatory and punitive damages, saying Fox News spread falsehoods with “intentional malice” that has affected job prospects she would have otherwise been considered for, the lawsuit says. 

“Even after achieving their stated goal of driving me out of government and ending the board, they kept using me as a punching bag,” Jankowicz told The Times. “It shouldn’t be something we just accept — that the most powerful cable network in the world can attack individuals willy-nilly and not face any consequences after they ruin their lives.”",https://gizmodo.com/fox-news-defamation-tucker-carlson-nina-jankowicz-1850428292
5/11/2023,Peloton Recalls 2 Million Bikes Because Their Seats Break Off During Hardcore Pedaling,"Peloton said the the support bar for the seat on its bikes was liable to breaking.

Peloton has yet to catch its breath after years of losses and sweeping changes in the exercise machine market, and the hits just keep coming. On Thursday, the company recalled around 2.2 million of its most popular bike model, saying that the machine was likely to break at one of its most critical points: where users place their butt.

The bike model is the PL-01, which the company described as the “original” bike sold between 2018 and 2023. Out of the 2.16 million units sold, Peleton’s said it’s received 35 reports of its bike seats breaking off completely during use. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, of those injuries, 13 reported receiving injuries from falling off the bike, including lacerations, bruises, and even a fractured wrist.

Peloton is offering users a free seat post to all Bike Members in the U.S. The part needs to be ordered from Peloton and then self-installed. If you want a full refund for your bike, you’re probably out of luck. Users can’t get a refund unless they’re still within the first 30 days of their delivery date. Users can either go to the product recall page (you need a Peloton account) or call the company to receive their replacement seat.

Peloton called this recall “voluntary,” though it does come after the company paid the CPSC $19 million over allegations it ignored issues with its Tread+ treadmill. That treadmill was linked to the death of a six-year-old back in 2021.

After years of losses and other post-pandemic issues, Peloton said earlier this month it would try to “relaunch” its brand. This included a revitalized app with a tiered membership structure, all while making the business more focused on workout software rather than its expensive exercise hardware. Otherwise, its bikes would instead be pushed more toward commercial settings like hotels.

The exercise hardware company has already mentioned that it was scaling back on producing its own machines alongside reports unsold bikes were cluttering up its warehouses.

5/11/2023,Robinhood Wants Its Favorite Meme Stock Traders to Buy and Sell 24 Hours a Day,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, left, said that always-on, 24-hour trading is ‘how the market should work.’

Stock trading app Robinhood wants to edge out the behemoth that is the New York Stock exchange. Rather than eating from the same dish of its own personal sheriff of Nottingham, the app that was once the darling of the WallStreetBets crowd is hoping its always-on audience might appreciate the ability to buy and sell stocks at every hour of the day.

The company proclaimed it was working on 24-hour trading for certain stocks in its latest quarterly financial report released Wednesday. Vlad Tenev, the Robinhood CEO, told investors that this service would launch “next week,” while quarterly filings revealed the service would start with more than 40 “well-known” stocks and exchange-traded funds. According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, trading would open perpetually from 8 p.m. ET Sunday and 8 p.m. ET Friday. Some of these big stocks include the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Tesla.

ADVERTISEMENT

Tenev told WSJ that the company will add more stocks to its always-on service over time, adding that this 24-hour trading “is how the market should work” since it won’t be tied to a single time zone and its working hours. While there are some other services that allow for limited early morning trading of ETFs, this would be one of the first firms to allow overnight trading of big-name stocks.

Per the Journal, all trades after 8 p.m. ET will be sent to trading platform Blue Ocean, then through a number of firms trying to profit off of stocks. Though there will certainly be a number of late-night, bleary-eyed, stock-obsessed folks punching in numbers like a gambler at a slot machine, it will still be hard to topple the might of Wall Street. In its latest quarterly financial report, the company did say it experienced a bump in monthly active users to about 11.8 million. The company had experienced a long decline in users since highs of 21.3 million in the middle of 2021. The NYSE claims it had a daily volume of 38.3 million contracts in 2022.

The company is also hoping it can add futures trading by the end of the year, pending approval of a Futures Commission Merchant License, something which one Redditor on the r/WallStreetBets said was like “trusting a toddler with napalm.” Though the memestock crowd is overall excited by the prospect of 24/5 trading. It might be enough to drag back some traders still angry over how Robinhood halted trades of volatile meme stocks during the original GameStop short craze.

Robinhood’s ambitions may be hampered by ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Bloomberg first reported based on the company’s filings that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is delving into the company’s recordkeeping requirements, which supposedly involved “off-channel communications.” The enforcement arm of the SEC is also investigating whether Robinhood kept to the book when reporting trades related to securities.

ADVERTISEMENT

The SEC’s investigation could be similar to last year when bankers got hit for illegally communicating in private channels on apps like WhatsApp. Gizmodo reached out to the SEC for comment on the investigation and a spokesperson told us the agency “does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.” The company already had to pay $30 million to the New York Department of Financial Services last year over allegations it failed to maintain compliant cybersecurity.

After it took hits from hackers, customers, politicians, and regulators, Robinhood had a bad 2022 resulting in layoffs and declines in revenue. The company reported Wednesday its revenue was up 47% from the same time last year, though it still experienced losses for the seventh consecutive quarter.",https://gizmodo.com/robinhood-meme-stock-apple-nyse-1850427929
5/11/2023,YouTube Is Forcing Some Users to Disable Adblockers,"Illustration: Artem Mashchenko (Shutterstock)

YouTube is cracking down on users determined to evade its ads and has given some of them an ultimatum: Turn off your ad blocker or subscribe to YouTube Premium. Ad-blocking users who don’t opt for either of those options won’t be able to watch videos on YouTube at all.

The measure is part of a limited global test being carried out by the company to ensure advertisers continue to get the most views for their money, Bleeping Computer reported. Alphabet, YouTube’s parent company, reported that the video app experienced its third straight quarterly decline in ad revenue in late April, prompted by the volatile digital ad market and broader economic uncertainty.

ADVERTISEMENT

YouTube’s ad blocking test was spotted by Reddit users earlier this week, who encountered a pop-up that stated “Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube” when they tried to watch a video.

“It looks like you may be using an ad blocker,” the message on the pop-up reads, according to a screenshot shared on r/YouTube. “Ads allow YouTube to stay free for billions of users worldwide. You can go ad-free with YouTube Premium, and creators can still get paid from your subscription.”

Users are then given the option to disable their ad blockers or subscribe to YouTube Premium, which costs $11.99 per month. A YouTube Premium subscription lets subscribers watch YouTube ad-free, play videos in the background while using other apps, allows offline downloads, and provides access to YouTube Music.

A YouTube spokesperson told Bleeping Computer the pop-up was authentic and part of a “small experiment.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“We’re running a small experiment globally that urges viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium,” the spokesperson said. “Ad blocker detection is not new, and other publishers regularly ask viewers to disable ad blockers.” Gizmodo reached out to YouTube for comment on Thursday morning but did not immediately receive a response.

Users fumed over the blocker-blocking test on Twitter, where the term “adblock” was a trending topic on Thursday morning. “Stop forcing ads down my throat and maybe I’d stop using an Adblock. How is this so hard for sites to understand?” Twitter user @Thunder_THR stated.",https://gizmodo.com/youtube-premium-ad-blockers-disable-test-google-1850427557
5/10/2023,Advertising on Twitter Means You Support Tucker Carlson Now,"Photo: Chip Somodevilla / Staff (Getty Images)

Tucker Carlson made a dazzling announcement on Tuesday: the recently-fired Fox News star will host his next show on Twitter. Carlson’s new broadcasts, which could cost him the $25 million Fox still owes him, will bring Twitter more attention, but they may spell bad news for the company’s bottom line.

If Carlson and Elon Musk follow through on their plans for a show and a revenue-sharing product, respectively, money spent on Twitter ads could go directly into the TV anchor’s pockets. Given Carlson’s noxious reputation, that’s likely to drive brands even further away from an already struggling Twitter.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Starting soon we’ll be bringing a new version of the show we’ve been doing for six and a half years to Twitter,” Carlson said in his video Tuesday. “Twitter has long served as the place where our national conversation incubates and develops. Twitter is not a partisan site. Everybody is allowed here. And we think that’s a good thing.”


Musk and Carlson have a similar problem. They are two of the most famous men in America, but big advertisers fear their erratic behavior. Both men’s businesses are totally dependent on ad dollars, at least for now. With Carlson’s new show, it’s possible these right-wing darlings have poked holes in the same sinking ship.

After the video posted, Musk seemed to acknowledge the potential issue. The CEO tweeted that his company hasn’t “signed a deal of any kind” with Carlson, though he himself has appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight multiple times. Musk said Twitter will fact-check “anything misleading” posted on the platform, and said he hoped leftist creators will follow Carlson’s lead. Musk did nod to his plans to compensate Twitter’s new VIP, however, and therein lies the problem.

“Tucker is subject to the same rules [and] rewards of all content creators,” Musk said. “Rewards means subscriptions and advertising revenue share (coming soon), which is a function of how many people subscribe and the advertising views associated with the content.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Musk has spent the last few months months touting a plan to share ad money with creators, so far with nothing to show for it. According to Musk, the idea is people who participate in Twitter’s new subscription program will get a cut of the money for any ads that display in the comments of their posts. At some point.

In other words, if you buy an ad on Twitter, the money could go directly into Carlson’s pocket. Potentially a lot of money, if Carlson attracts a lot of viewers. At the very least, any advertiser on Twitter is keeping the lights on at Tucker’s new home. Recent history shows that’s an association that big brands don’t want.

ADVERTISEMENT

“When it comes to brand safety, yes, if you are advertising on Twitter at this point, you are funding Tucker Carlson,” said Nandini Jammi, co-founder of Check My Ads, a non-profit ad tech watchdog that documents how online ads fuel the misinformation economy.

ADVERTISEMENT

Taking his wares to Twitter is a big step down for Carlson and could be a major financial loss due to his own breach of contract. Reports suggest the new show will cost the former host $25 million due to a non-compete agreement with Fox. It’s likely that he hopes to build up his own audience to monetize directly, though tying yourself to a man as chaotic as Musk is a dangerous game. At the end of the video announcing the plan, Carlson directs viewers to his website, where you’re encouraged to provide your email. If nothing else, Carlson may sell some swag, which includes golf balls, socks, and a $165 shoulder bag adorned with his name.

There were other options, some which seemed far more obvious. Newsmax—an aging but agile cable news network that’s even farther to the right than Fox—has said it would gladly offer Carlson a new home. It’s possible the Twitter plan came out of a recent glad-handing interview Tucker held with Musk on his now-dead Fox program, which saw Carlson fawning over the billionaire’s patently absurd ideas.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Carlson is still enormously popular, and his loyal fans may be willing to pay for access to a subscription-only broadcast,” said Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at Insider Intelligence. “That could boost Twitter’s non-ad revenues, but I’m not fully convinced that enough people will sign up to watch a show they used to access for free, on a platform they are accustomed to accessing for free, for it to make a significant impact on Twitter’s bottom line.”

Twitter’s subscription offering, which lets users set up a paid tier for exclusive content, is part of a series of efforts to diversify the company’s revenue. The most famous endeavor is Musk’s change to Twitter’s verification system, which no longer verifies people’s identities and is now available to any user for $8 a month. It’s been an unmitigated disaster. On the day Twitter removed the blue check marks from the estimated 407,000 accounts with legacy verification status, reports said just twenty eight new users signed up for the paid Twitter Blue.


ADVERTISEMENT

“Carlson could exacerbate Twitter’s advertising problems, and many brands will continue to steer clear due to both brand safety concerns about the content as well as the overall risk of being associated with him,” said Enberg. “Twitter is still a platform that thrives on news and controversy, and Carlson provides plenty of the latter. That could boost engagement for Twitter, but the quality of that engagement isn’t likely to be the kind that will attract advertisers, either.”

In the climate Musk and Tucker built for themselves, tying your ad money to their projects could generate public condemnation. Representatives from the advocacy groups Free Press, Media Matters, Accountable Tech, and the Center For Countering Digital Hate all told Gizmodo that Carlson’s new show will be even worse for the reputation of any brand that chooses to advertise on Twitter.


ADVERTISEMENT

“This puts Twitter in direct conflict with the core values of thousands of household brands,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. “Many have already decided to leave the platform. The ones who remain must decide whether they want to continue to prop up Musk’s project, or stand up for their beliefs in tolerance, inclusivity and enlightenment.”

Both Carlson and Twitter are suffering from longstanding advertising droughts thanks to their respective controversies. Jammi said the partnership could make exacerbate the problem. “When an advertiser leaves, new advertisers don’t come in and replace them, because the ad space is now known as a slot for toxic content,” she said.

ADVERTISEMENT

When Musk bought Twitter, it started a mass exodus of the platform’s biggest advertisers, worried about their reputations amidst skyrocketing hate speech and other unpleasant content. That’s a crisis for a social media platform, though Musk swears things are fine.

Over the past few years, Carlson has had the same issue, with advertisers boycotting his show in spite of sky-high ratings. Fox unexpectedly fired Carlson two weeks ago, and it didn’t offer any satisfying official explanation for cutting ties with its biggest star. That may be because the truth is something Fox doesn’t want to admit: some observers say Tucker Carlson Tonight was losing money. By the time of its demise, the show didn’t have a single blue chip advertiser.

ADVERTISEMENT

Big brands have been fleeing Carlson since at least 2019, sometimes in organized boycotts over his penchant for controversy, bigotry, and blatant misinformation. That was already a problem before Fox’s $787 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, announced just before Carlson’s firing. Carlson himself was muted on the subject of Dominion conspiracy theories in comparison to his fellow hosts, but private texts emerged in discovery that showed him deriding a female colleague as a “c**t.” Making matters worse, one of Carlson’s former senior producers filed a lawsuit accusing him of bullying and sexual harassment, a type of suit Fox is all too familiar with.

Carlson could not immediately be reached for comment. Musk reportedly fired Twitter’s communication department, and set its press email to auto-reply with a poop emoji. The company did not otherwise respond to a request for comment.


ADVERTISEMENT

On Tuesday, Carlson’s attorneys sent a letter to Fox accusing the network of “fraud” and “breach of contract.” The letter alleges that network executives—including Rupert Murdoch—broke “material” promises to Carlson, an act the letter defines as fraud. Those promises include ones not to leak Carlson’s private communications and to not settle its recent Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit in a way that would denigrate Carlson’s reputation, Axios reports.

Reports suggest more than half of Twitter Blue early adopters have since canceled their subscriptions. Twitter’s blue check mark was a sign you were important, at least by the company’s standards. A savvy marketer could easily convince people to pay for something like that. Instead, Elon Musk, a man hailed for decades as a business maverick, turned a status symbol into a mark of Cain.


ADVERTISEMENT

Advertisers can move mountains in a business that is entirely dependent on them. In 2020, more than 1,000 companies joined in a major boycott of Facebook (the company now known as Meta) over the company’s handling of hate speech and misinformation. The business didn’t suffer in any meaningful way, but the boycott dealt a painful blow to the platform’s reputation. Meta has never acknowledged it, but the boycott may be partially responsible for the company’s subsequent moves to take these problems more seriously.


On the other hand, Musk hasn’t responded to similar pressure, and Twitter suffers because of it. Advertisers don’t need a boycott to stay away from Twitter, but there are calls for one anyway. When Musk spoke at a recent Miami advertising conference, a coalition of advocacy organizations hired a plane to fly banners over the city reading “Musk is bad for business #StopToxicTwitter.”",https://gizmodo.com/tucker-carlson-twitter-elon-musk-ads-advertisers-1850424480
5/10/2023,American Psychological Association Says Parents Should Screen Kids for 'Problematic Social Media Use',"Photo: Leon Neal (Getty Images)

The American Psychological Association, one of the country’s leading mental health organizations, released its first health advisory on social media Tuesday, warning parents and policymakers alike about the harms and benefits platforms could bring to young children.

The APA report may have stopped short of flat-out casting aside social media entirely, but it did still offer 10 recommendations to parents and policymakers on how to avoid potentially harmful outcomes. For starters, the APA said parents should regularly screen kids for “problematic social media use” that could interfere with their daily lives. Examples of these problematic use cases, the report notes, can include kids continuing to use social media even when they want to stop or cases where they engage in lying and other deceptive behavior to stay online. The report encourages active “adult monitoring” of social media use by children between the ages of 10-14 but quickly caveated that by saying such monitoring should be “balanced with youths’ appropriate needs for privacy.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“Is it hard for them [kids] to detach from social media? Do they lie so they can engage with it?” APA CEO Arthur Evans said in an interview with NPR. “Those are the kinds of things that parents should be on the lookout for when they’re monitoring their child’s social media use.”

What did the APA recommend?

Most of the recommendations provided focus less on the actual algorithms and other technology underpinning social networks and more on young users’ relationships with the tech. The APA suggests limiting kids’ screen time, for example, not necessarily because that inherently leads to mental health harms, but because it could interfere with a child’s sleep, which studies have associated with neurological development in adolescent brains.


Elsewhere, the advisory recommends young users minimize the amount of time they spend on platforms comparing themselves to others or viewing illegal or psychologically maladaptive behavior because those actions are also associated with psychological harm. Parents of young users, the advisory notes, should minimize the time kids are exposed to posts related to suicide, self-harm, disordered eating, or other dangerous topics. That sounds reasonable and intuitive on its face, but finding ways to encourage parents to actually adhere to those guidelines in practice without invading their child’s sense of privacy is another feat altogether.

The advisory—which comes hot on the heels of dozens of proposed state child online safety bills—attempts to strike a balance between acknowledging areas of potential harm and advocating for increased parental oversight while simultaneously avoiding painting all social media use with an overly broad brush.

ADVERTISEMENT

Right away, the APA acknowledges social media “is not inherently beneficial or harmful to young people,” but rather is highly variable depending on the personal and psychological characteristics of the user accessing the services. Young users already struggling with body image issues or depression, for example, may be more prone to experience negative outcomes on platforms than their peers. On the flip side, the report notes, young people struggling with mental health issues or others from marginalized groups may actually benefit from the support networks and advice they receive from other like-minded people on social media which may actually aid psychological development.

“In most cases, the effects of social media are dependent on adolescents’ own personal and psychological characteristics and social circumstances,” the APA notes. “Intersecting with the specific content, features, or functions that are afforded within many social media platforms.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Despite mounting pressure from lawmakers and child safety activists to do something about Big Tech’s perceived effect on child mental health, the APA report claims “causal associations” directly linking adolescent social media use to negative health outcomes are still a rarity in available research. Instead, the report says kids’ online experiences are more likely affected by who they choose to like and follow as well as the social contexts and environments in which they were raised.

“While politicians are racing ahead with proposals based on the premise that simply encountering content on social media is causing ... harms, the APA notes that the actual research is far less conclusive and far more nuanced than lawmakers’ rhetoric,” Fight for the Future Executive Director Evan Greer said. “Without proper research, we can’t meaningfully evaluate the tradeoffs.”

ADVERTISEMENT
A growing consensus around social media’s harms is emerging 


Social science researchers and advocates have hotly debated the exact degree to which social media affects kids’ mental health for years, but some rudimentary consensus, and calls for action, have finally begun to emerge. Earlier this year, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told CNN he believed the 13-year-old sign-up age cutoff from many social media companies was simply too young because children that age is still “developing their identity.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“I, personally, based on the data I’ve seen, believe that 13 is too early,” Murthy said. “If parents can band together and say you know, as a group, we’re not going to allow our kids to use social media until 16 or 17 or 18 or whatever age they choose, that’s a much more effective strategy in making sure your kids don’t get exposed to harm early.”

President Biden echoed that sentiment during his State of the Union address in February where he urged tech companies to limit the amount of data they collect from children and called on Congress to pass legislation banning targeting advertising against children.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit,” Biden said

Lawmakers want online child safety laws but can’t agree on where to draw the line 

A Politico report released last month estimates more than 27 different bills have been proposed in at least 16 different state houses all trying to get at the issue of kids’ online safety, though often from markedly different angles. Many of those bills coalesce around issues like restricting target advertising to children or banning allegedly addictive social media designs. The bills often diverge, however, around the issue of mandated parental guidance over kids to access these platforms.

ADVERTISEMENT

Arkansas and Utah have both passed legislation requiring parents to grant permission for a child to use a social media account. In the latter case, the laws would go a step further and prohibit users under the age of 18 from accessing social media apps between 10:30 PM and 6:30 AM. Rights groups like Fight for the Future and The Center for Democracy & Technology vigorously oppose the age verification techniques and parental monitoring stipulations in the bills, and say they would “make kids less safe, and would be weaponized to attack.”",https://gizmodo.com/american-psychological-association-kids-social-media-1850424387
5/10/2023,Trump’s Truth Social Posts Cost Him $3 Million in E Jean Carroll Trial,"Writer E. Jean Carroll accused former President Donald Trump of sexually abusing her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s. Trump recently publicly posted on Truth Social calling the trial ‘a hoax.’

Lizzo was right: Truth Hurts. Two of Donald Trump’s “Truths” on his own Truth Social platform will cost the ex-president millions, even as he avoids full liability for the alleged rape of magazine writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s.

According to reports coming out of the courtroom, the federal jury of six men and three women told the court Tuesday afternoon that they had determined Trump sexually abused Carroll and that the former president had injured her reputation through a series of posts on Truth in October last year. He’s now liable for $2 million in damages for sexually abusing and an additional $3 million for defaming Carroll. Trump’s attorneys said they will appeal.


ADVERTISEMENT

In those two Truth Social posts, Trump said the case was “a made up SCAM,” called her lawyer “a political operative, financed by a big political donor.” He also wrote “Does anybody believe that I would take a then almost 60 year old woman that I didn’t know, from the front door of a very crowded department store, (with me being very well known, to put it mildly!), into a tiny dressing room, and …. her.”

The jury said they determined Trump knew his statement about the lawsuit being a hoax was false, and thus defamatory under New York’s stringent standard of “actual malice.” As reported by The New York Times, Medill School of Journalism professor Ashlee Humphreys testified on behalf of Carroll during the trial that it would cost Carroll $2.7 million to repair reputational damage caused by Trump.

The reputational damages specifically include $1 million in damages unrelated to a reputation repair initiative, and another $1.7 million to mend her image.

Trump’s legal team was ready right out of the court with a lengthy and rambling response to the verdict, proclaiming that the verdict was all a ploy by the Democratic Party. His spokespeople further mentioned there were “false and totally made-up claims from troubled individuals to interfere with our elections, doing great damage.” Of course, Trump would know all about made-up claims doing great damage to U.S. elections.

ADVERTISEMENT

Though Trump did not seem too aware how his Truths contributed to the damages owed. Just minutes after the verdict was read out in court, Trump posted on Truth Social “I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. The verdict is a disgrace - a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.”

Trump never testified at the trial despite his invite being extended through last weekend. He did provide some comments in a video deposition where he further claimed Carroll was “not my type.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump’s attorney, Joe Tacopina, reportedly told the jury that Carroll’s account was “unbelievable” and that she had used the accusation to sell a 2019 book where she originally accused the former president of sexually abusing and raping her at a department store in 1996.

The former president has been on a Truth Social kick as of late, repeatedly proclaiming he was the subject of some great “witch hunt” against him after he was charged with using campaign funds to pay affair hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He further called Daniels, AKA Stephanie Clifford, “Horseface” and tried to paint the federal charges as an “extortion plot.”

Though Trump is contractually obligated to post on the social media platform he helped found, Truth Social itself isn’t doing too well. The company is under the cloud of a federal investigation, and the company has warned it could lose its place on the Nasdaq stock exchange due to not paying its necessary fees.

5/9/2023,LinkedIn's App Leaves China for Good,"Photo: Carl Court (Getty Images)

Microsoft-owned LinkedIn is taking the final steps in its long exit from China, making it the last of the major US social networks to exit the region amid increased domestic competition and untenable geopolitical compromises. The company announced late Monday it would lay off 716 employees in its Global Business Organization and shutter the Chinese version of its app.

LinkedIn CEO Ryan ​​Roslansky broke the news in a Monday evening letter sent to staff.​​ Roslansky said LinkedIn’s scaled-back “InCareer” iteration of the app in China experienced “some success” but ultimately couldn’t keep up with stronger homegrown alternatives. The layoffs include a total discontinuation of the engineering and product teams in the area as well as a significant downsizing of sales and marketing functions. Some employees will remain in China, but they will focus on helping other companies in China hire and train employees. LinkedIn plans to officially shut down the InCareer app by August 9.

“Though InCareer experienced some success in the past year thanks to our strong China-based team, it also encountered fierce competition and a challenging macroeconomic climate,” ​​Roslansky wrote.

LinkedIn’s China App wind down was two years in the making

LinkedIn’s Chinese social media app operation will shutter in August, but its operation there has been winding down for years. In 2021, Linkedin announced it would leave China, removing its flagship app from the region due to “a significantly more challenging operating environment” and eventually replacing it with a much more scaled-back job searching alternative called InJobs, later InCareer. The company’s carefully worded statement at the time downplayed an escalating geopolitical headache.

LinkedIn was granted the opportunity to continue operating in China long after other US social media firms were banned in exchange for agreeing to play by the government’s tight censorship rules. But that agreement grew tense. In the months leading up to LinkedIn’s initial scaleback, China’s top internet regulator punished LinkedIn executives for failing to properly control political content on the platform, according to the New York Times. The regulator forced LinkedIn to suspend new signups and perform a self-evaluation for a report sent to China’s Cyberspace Administration. At the same time, activists and lawmakers in the US criticized the company for censoring multiple accounts of American journalists and academics operating on the China-based platform. Even the app’s estimated 54 million users in the country weren’t enough to justify the unavoidable political landmines.

“This decision aligns with our commitment to creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce, LinkedIn Senior Vice President of Engineering Mohak Shroff said at the time. “While that has been our vision for nearly two decades now, it feels more important than ever as we all strive to build a global economy that delivers more prosperity and progress to people all over the world.”

An increasingly fractured internet

LinkedIn was the last major US social media company to hold any meaningful presence in China. The country blocked both Twitter and Facebook back in 2009 following violent government crackdowns against activists in the Xinjiang province. Instagram and WhatsApp were available for a few more years but were blocked in 2014 and 2017 respectively. Other companies like Google who have tried to compromise with government officials to bring services back online in China and tap into its massive market share have faced fierce blowback from staff and US critics.

Outside of China, calls by lawmakers in the US and around the world to ban TikTok are reaching a fever pitch over alleged, but still unproven, concerns of potential foreign government espionage. If those national bans are allowed to move forward, it could set a precedent for the US and other countries to enact sweeping restrictions on other foreign apps using the same, broad national security concerns. The end result of those tit-for-tat app bans is multiple versions of siloed internet.",https://gizmodo.com/linkedin-china-layoffs-incareer-leaves-for-good-1850419303
5/9/2023,'Guilt-Tipping' Has Hit the Self-Checkout Aisle,"Tipflation, also known as tip creep, has inundated consumers in a post-covid world.

In a world of all-consuming tipflation, it feels like we can never get away from hearing the dreaded “The iPad is just going to ask you a quick question” before being presented with what can feel like a Sophie’s choice of tipping options. Unfortunately, it would appear that the self-checkout line is no longer a respite from feeling pressured to tip for every transaction you make.


The Wall Street Journal reports that tipping at self-checkout has come to airports, stadiums, cookie shops, and cafes, with some prompts requesting a firm 20% tip. Self-checkout kiosks have famously negated the need for a face-to-face human interaction, so the prompt to tip seemingly nobody has left some consumers confused and frustrated. Tipflation, also known as tip creep, has inundated consumers in a post-covid world as stores and companies try to snag some extra income, but a corporation asking a customer to tip while that customer is doing all of the work during the transaction is a heinous example of a trend gone too far.

“Just the prompt in general is a bit of emotional blackmail,” said 26-year-old Garrett Bemiller to the Journal.

According to the outlet, Bemiller was purchasing a bottle of water at Newark International Liberty Airport in Newark, New Jersey. Choosing the self-checkout line allowed Bemiller to ignore the hullaballoo of dealing with another person within the stress-inducing confines of an airport. However, Bemiller was gobsmacked to see tip amounts amended to the already lofty price of an airport water bottle. In a similar case, 28-year-old Corey Gary was prompted to leave a tip at a self-service beer fridge in San Diego’s Petco Park. Gary told the Journal that he wasn’t clear where the money was going, but left 20% anyway.

The Wall Street Journal reached out to the companies and locations that are offering the tip options at self-checkout kiosks and found that most believe the prompt is always optional. A spokesperson for Petco Park told the outlet that guests are encouraged to leave tips, but it is not mandatory, and that tips are split amongst the staff. A Crumbl spokesperson gave the Journal a similar sentiment.

At the end of the day, sure, tipping humans for their work is common practice and typically the nice thing to do. But ultimately, it’s up to the consumer to decide whether or not to leave a tip and how much to tip. Even just automatically being presented the option to tip introduces an increased expectation and social pressure into the equation. Meng Zhu, a Johns Hopkins professor studying consumer behavior, told Vox that not only does presenting a tip option pressure consumers to tip, it also guides them to amounts that the business wants. As Vox points out, businesses can suggest any percentage or dollar amount they want, and even turn on “smart tipping,” where tip options switch between percentages or dollar amounts depending on the total, which can confuse customers. All the while, those same customers are guilted into forking over more money.

“Let’s say you already shopped at a restaurant or coffee shop. You’re already committed,” Zhu said. “When they ask you for something else, you’re more likely to comply because you want to be consistent with your earlier decision.”",https://gizmodo.com/tipping-self-check-out-1850419084
5/9/2023,Google Jams Even More Ads in Your Gmail Inbox,"Photo: cjmacer / Shutterstock.com / Google / Thomas Germain (Shutterstock)

Despite scientists’ best efforts, there’s still no way to inject ads directly into your veins, so Google is going for the next best thing. Reports from angry emailers across the web show Google cramming even more ads into one place where you can’t look away: your Gmail inbox.

Not only is the number of ads going up, but Gmail is sticking the ads in new, confusing places. Google used to restrain itself to two ads at the top of your Gmail inbox. Now, it seems, Gmail is bold enough to put the ads amidst all your emails right in the center of your inbox. It’s little ads masquerading as real emails, sitting innocently between your actual real emails. Take a look at these screenshots posted on Twitter, spotted first by 9to5Google.

The team running Gmail’s Twitter account agrees that this whole thing is a bummer. TechRadar spotted one user tweeting at Gmail, complaining about the ads in the middle of their god forsaken inbox. Gmail’s social media team responded, “That doesn’t sound good.” Nice that we’re all on the same page about this.

“We are always experimenting with ads formats and working on ways to help people discover and connect with new businesses,” a Google spokesperson said. “The Promotions tab shows promotional emails from businesses that people subscribe to, as well as offers and deals from companies people might like. We rolled out instream ads in the Promotions tab last year across mobile and in the past month expanded to desktop as well.” The spokesperson said that Google never uses the data users create or store in Gmail for ads, and said all of Google’s Gmail advertising includes an “Ad” label, which you can see in the examples above

Unfortunately, we’re not all lucky enough to see this exciting new experiment in marketing, at least not yet. Google appears to be in the midst of a test, showing these ads to some users and not to others. I just checked my own Gmail and didn’t see the new messages from corporations I was hoping for.


ADVERTISEMENT

My inbox is filled to the brim with spam, though! That’s one form of advertising that Google doesn’t seem to like. In just the last week, Google announced new efforts to protect users from spam. Funny, if ya’ think about it, because these new ads are similar: messages that you didn’t sign up for clogging your email inbox. Of course, the big difference is that with regular old spam, Google doesn’t get a cut of the profits.

If Google follows through on this new ad plan, it will be one more entry in a growing trend. The tech business—and just about every other business—is hard at working finding more ways to show you more ads. Apple, for example, shoved new ads in the App Store recently, and reportedly plans on new advertising in its Apple TV service. Meta somehow found a way to put more ads on Instagram, and Google’s already introduced new ad formats on other parts of the web as well.

We’re in the middle of economic shrinkage, whether or not it’s a full blown recession. That, along with other forces, is pressuring companies to boost their revenue. Advertising is a simple and guaranteed way to bring in more cash. The only downside is your experience of the entire world gets more annoying in the process. Sorry, kids.

5/8/2023,Airlines Will Have to Pay Passengers for Delays Under New Biden Admin Rules,"Photo: David McNew / Stringer (Getty Images)

Even if you’re not an anxious flyer, booking a plane trip can sometimes feel like rolling the dice. Will you make the tight-turnaround connecting flight? Will your carry on fit in the overhead bin? Will you end up stuck, waiting in the terminal or worse—on the tarmac? And honestly, the odds aren’t great. So far in 2023, about one in five flights have been delayed, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation. But soon, significant travel disruption could at least come with a consolation prize.


The Biden Administration is set to create new rules, requiring airlines to compensate passengers and pay for customer’s additional expenses in instances where flights are significantly delayed or cancelled. The rulemaking, announced Monday in a DOT press release, would cover “controllable” scenarios—in which airlines are responsible for travel interruptions (i.e. probably not weather-related schedule changes).

ADVERTISEMENT

In response to such disruptions, the to-come rules would ensure passengers receive compensation in the form of cash, meals or meal vouchers, overnight accommodations, and/or transportation to and from any offsite hotel. Any regulation would also include definitions for all eligible scenarios, including what a “significant delay” is.

“When an airline causes a flight cancellation or delay, passengers should not foot the bill,” said Pete Buttigieg, U.S. Transportation Secretary, in a statement. “This rule would, for the first time in U.S. history, propose to require airlines to compensate passengers and cover expenses.”


This past winter holiday season was a travel nightmare. Thousands of flights were cancelled and millions of travelers were left stranded amid the chaos. Summer 2022, too, was a terrible time for travel worldwide. “Last summer we saw unacceptable rates of delays and cancellations, even on blue sky days,” said Buttigieg during a Monday speech. “Summer travel is going to put enormous pressure on the system,” he added.

So it makes sense that the Biden Administration would be aiming to address the problem now—ahead of the next busy summer travel season. Last August, U.S. legislators introduced a similar set of rules in the Senate, through the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act. But so far, that bill hasn’t progressed beyond committee. Enter, the executive branch.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Historically, when delays and cancellations are the airlines’ fault, the law has only required airlines to refund customers the price of their flight ticket—but not the cost of meals, hotels, or transportation when you get left in limbo,” President Joe Biden said during a Monday afternoon speech. Already, there’ve been some strides to remedy this. Biden pointed out that—facing political pressure—some airlines have begun to offer hotel accommodation and other protections in the face of delays and cancellations. But the new rules would push this further—making such compensation a requirement.

In Biden’s words, getting your money’s worth would be, “not voluntary, but mandatory.” All U.S. airlines would have to “compensate you with meals, hotels, taxis, rideshares, and re-booking fees—and cash miles and/or travel vouchers whenever they’re the ones to blame for the cancellation or delay. And that’s on top of refunding the cost of your ticket,” Biden explained. The European Union and Canada already have similar regulations in place, he said.

ADVERTISEMENT

This week’s White House rulemaking announcement follows other recent consumer airline protections from the Biden Administration. In September, the DOT added cost transparency and refund requirements to the wild west of in-flight WiFi and bag check fees. And though admin officials are just at the beginning of the regulatory process, other DOT updates make it easy to find out what airlines already offer when it comes to delays and cancellations.

The transportation department has also  its Airline Customer Service Dashboard, accessible at FlightRights.Gov. The digital tool details 10 different carriers’ existing policies when it comes to delays and cancellations. Right now, none of the listed airlines offer cash compensation for 3+ hour delays. Biden and Buttigieg’s new efforts should change that.

More details on the forthcoming airline regulations will be available in a Monday 2:30 P.M. White House briefing.",https://gizmodo.com/airlines-travel-delayed-flights-delta-southwest-1850415370
5/6/2023,22 Unhinged (but Fake) App Features,"Image: Soren Iverson

At the tail end of 2022, screenshots of bizarre app features started going viral on Twitter. They rested just on the line between plausible and absurd. Google isn’t going to add punctuality scores to calendar invites, but it could if it wanted to. Or what if Instagram sent a warning if you accidentally like a three year old photo during a late night stalking session? It might actually be useful, as long as the company doesn’t charge you $5 for it.

Soren Iverson is the man behind the memes. As a product designer, Iverson works in one of the more artistic corners of the tech industry. It’s people like Iverson who figure out the look, feel and function of the parts of apps and websites we actually interact with. The work is creative, but it’s serious business when you’re talking about apps with millions of users. “These small improvements can have massive implications when you’re working within a larger ecosystem,” Iverson said.

Iverson started coming up with strange design elements for existing apps and posting them on Twitter to test and invigorate his own creativity. Apps like iMessage, Uber Eats, Tinder, we interact with them so often they can feel like part of our identities. The ideas he posted, the more people responded. Eventually Iverson started a practice of posting one new idea every day.


“I think the mental model I’ve used is if a product manager learned Figma and gave into their most intrusive thoughts,” he said. “For how seriously I take the work that actually gets put into prod, this is a very opposite end of the spectrum. You’re allowed to just throw out ideas even if they’re insane.”

Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News, would very much appreciate it if Media Matters for America would stop monitoring media. The Rupert Murdoch-owned network sent Media Matters a cease and desist letter on Friday, demanding that the non-profit watchdog take down leaked, behind-the-scenes footage of Tucker Carlson being an off-putting creep and criticizing his employer.

The Carlson videos, released under the headlines “FOXLEAKS...,” show the far-right former Fox pundit making off-the-cuff remarks about sexual technique, making lewd insinuations at a makeup artist, griping about court proceedings, and lambasting Fox’s online streaming platform, Fox Nation. The videos add to the pile of potential reasons that Fox may have opted to fire Carlson last week, in the aftermath of the company’s ginormous settlement with Dominion Voting Systems.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the cease and desist letter, posted to Twitter by journalist Max Tani, Fox Corp. is adamant that the previously un-released footage is its own “confidential intellectual property” and that MMFA “unlawfully obtained” the videos. “This proprietary material was given to you without FOX’s authorization. Fox demands that Media Matters cease and desist from distribution, publication, and misuse of Fox’s misappropriated proprietary footage,” says the note. The letter is singed by an attorney at the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which represents Fox.

MMFA’s response to the cease and desist doesn’t suggest the non-profit is interested in complying. “Reporting on newsworthy leaked material is a cornerstone of journalism. For Fox to argue otherwise is absurd and further dispels any pretense that they’re a news operation,” wrote Angelo Carusone, MMFA president, in a statement emailed to Gizmodo. “Perhaps if I tell them that the footage came from a combination of WikiLeaks and Hunter Biden’s laptop, it will alleviate their concerns,” Carusone added.

So far, Media Mattershas  four videos of Carlson speaking off-air. In the most recent, the M&M’s superfan is shown asking a makeup artist applying powder to his face if “pillow fights ever break out” in the women’s bathroom. When she says no, he responds “OK...That’d be more a dorm activity.”

ADVERTISEMENT

In another set of videos he tells Piers Morgan, “if we’re going to talk about sex, I’d love to hit some of the fine points of technique.” In yet another, he describes and unknown person’s girlfriend as “kind of yummy,” in a shudder-inducing voice. A video from Tucker Carlson Today captures him saying he can’t assess his own appearance and simultaneously disparaging and sexualizing his audience, adding “I wait for my postmenopausal fans to weigh in on that.”

Media Matters also released a clip of the pundit bemoaning his participation in the Dominion trial, calling the election tech company’s lawyer a “slimy little motherfucker,” and saying the Dominion deposition “triggered the shit” of him.

ADVERTISEMENT

Together, all of the videos paint an unsettling and creepy portrait of an agro, misogynistic weirdo. But honestly, none of the quips come as a surprise. Carlson hasn’t exactly hidden his views on women (or racial minorities, or the LGBTQ community, etc...), and he has said many more damning things on-air over the course of his career. It’s hard to imagine all this rather run-of-the mill cringe got him ousted.

Yet additional footage shows Carlson critiquing Fox News management and the company’s Fox Nation streaming platform. Clearly, he had some issues with his bosses that he didn’t mind voicing in the workplace, and maybe that has something to do with why he’s not there anymore.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Nobody watches Fox Nation because the site sucks,” he says in the two minute video before entering into a full on tirade against the digital service:

﻿It’s hard to use that site. I don’t know why they’re not fixing it. It’s driving me insane. And they’re like making, like, Lifetime movies. But they don’t, they don’t work on the infrastructure of the site. Like what? It’s crazy. And it drives me crazy because it’s like we’re doing all this extra work and no one can find it. It’s unbelievable, actually.

...

We’re like working like animals to produce all this content, and the people in charge of it, whoever that guy’s, whatever his name is, like, they’re ignoring the fact that the site doesn’t work. And I think it’s like a betrayal of our efforts. That’s how I feel. So I, of course, I resent it.

ADVERTISEMENT

The cease and desist and related videos are just the latest bit of drama in the string of recent events concerning Fox and Carlson. The ultra-conservative commentator abruptly left Fox News at the end of April. Since 2016, he had hosted the talk show Tucker Carlson Tonight along with multiple other web-based series for Fox. Prior to that, he was a Fox contributor. His sudden departure (and likely firing) from the network, came just a few days after Fox Corp. was forced to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems in a massive $787.5 million payout agreement.

Many have speculated about the specifics of Carlson’s Fox exit since he left, considering he was one of the network’s biggest cash cows. Tucker Carlson Tonight was routinely one of the highest rated, most-watched cable news programs in the U.S. Yet Carlson’s likely role in the Dominion settlement seems to have played a big part in the network and Carlson parting ways.

ADVERTISEMENT

Dominion supplied voting machines to dozens of states ahead of the 2020 election. The company’s legal complaint against Fox revolved around unfounded voting fraud conspiracies—which the voting tech purveyor said Fox willfully perpetuated, despite knowing they were false.

During the legal discovery process, Dominion filed documents to back up its case, cataloging emails and texts from Fox News hosts that appeared to categorically demonstrate Fox figureheads didn’t buy the shit they were selling. Carlson’s internal communications surround the “Stop the Steal” election fraud conspiracies were uniquely and aggressively damning.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Those fuckers are destroying our credibility,” he wrote of prominent election deniers and Fox executives’ push to platform them. “Sidney Powell is lying. Fucking bitch,” he said in another communication. He described the network’s coverage as “shockingly reckless,” and stated the he was well aware there was no proof of election mishandling at Dominion. The list goes on.

Now, the MMFA videos offer an additional bit of clarity on Carlson’s antics on set and perhaps Fox’s overall reasoning for kicking him to the curb. Too bad for Fox, regardless of the “why” behind its decision, that doesn’t change the outcome for the network. Since Carlson has been off the air, Fox News’s viewership and ratings have plummeted.

Alex Jones—the bloated, misanthropic mannequin that spews hate and conspiracies with robotic efficiency—found himself at the mercy of a prank call earlier this week by a man claiming to be ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The jig was up, according to Jones, when the fake Carlson started saying “lewd, sexual things.”

Chris James, the YouTuber behind the NotEvenAShow channel, tweeted Wednesday that he used a spoofed version of Carlson’s phone number and an AI-generated version of the ex-Fox host’s voice to call Jones’ cell “and have a full conversation with him.” In other tweets, James said the call lasted about one minute.

ADVERTISEMENT

It’s unclear what program the YouTuber used to deepfake Carlson, but there’s plenty of easy-to-use AI-based programs out there like ElevenLabs. James’ episode on the prank is supposed to appear Monday, but Jones himself confirmed he was spoofed on recent episodes of his right wing conspiracy spectacular show InfoWars. While we don’t know the full scope of the conversation, Jones rambled for several minutes about what was said.

“It was Tucker Carlson’s voice, and it starts saying horrible, lewd sexual things for me,” Jones said on his Thursday show. “He stole Tucker Carlson’s identity. He faked his number. He faked his voice. He called me and made sexual threats, basically. And he just thinks that’s funny. Because in his sociopathic world, I don’t exist. Alex Jones is fair game for any attacks. So is Tucker Carlson.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The YouTuber said that since Jones aired that he had been spoofed, Jones fans were sending him “threatening messages.” He added that Jones talked to him on the phone and suggested that Carlson “is getting his lawyers involved” while at the same time asking the YouTuber to come on his show, which he “politely declined.”

Jones isn’t a very credible person on any topic, including his or other people’s intent. The InfoWars host is reportedly trying to hide millions of his dollars to avoid paying over $1 billion in damages for two separate lawsuits regarding the lies he told about the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting. On his Thursday show, he said he “doesn’t think” Carlson wants to press charges, but said James needs to come on the air to “explain that he’s not part of a government group or agency.”

ADVERTISEMENT

According to James, Jones kept on the phone for a while believing it was his good friend and fellow right wing conspiracy magnet Carlson. Earlier this year, The Huffington Post revealed texts between Carlson and Jones showing just how close the two were. The pair texted and traded jokes and complained about the way the media apparatus talked about famous conspiracies like former President Donald Trump’s infamous 2020 quote saying the U.S. could potentially use a “a very powerful light” to kill the coronavirus inside patients.

After Fox News paid out $787.5 million to Dominion Voting Systems over the company’s $1.5 billion defamation lawsuit, Carlson and Jones briefly had even more in common beyond their shared sense of white male grievance. Still, Carlson showed he was very able to speak out both sides of his mouth, as texts and emails from the lawsuit revealed Carlson could give credence to misinformation from the 2020 election deniers while calling them “fuckers” and “liars.” In that way, we may never truly know what Carlson really thinks of Jones.",https://gizmodo.com/alex-jones-ai-tucker-carlson-fox-news-infowars-1850410076

The Israeli government is taking action against crypto accounts it has deemed suspicious, closing down dozens on one of the largest platforms for the digital currency.

Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) has seized around 190 accounts on Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, for alleged ties to the Palestinian organization Hamas, according to a report by Reuters based on documents released by the country’s anti-terror authorities. Israel also claimed that two of the accounts belonged to the extremist group ISIS.

Israeli authorities recently announced that they confiscated over half a million Israeli shekels in digital currencies from accounts it claims fall under “currency exchange companies in the service of Hamas.” Under Israeli law, the ministry has the right to seize and confiscate property it deems could be linked to terrorism activities.

One of the documents states that the Israeli foreign ministry deemed this necessary to “thwart the activity of the terrorist organization the Islamic State (ISIS) and impair its ability to further its goals.”

The crypto firm Binance responded to Reuters’ report, claiming that the news organization was “leaving out critical facts to fit their narrative.” In its statement, Binance claimed that it had been working closely with counter-terrorism authorities to support their investigations and seize the allegedly suspicious accounts. The company also stated that its policies comply with “anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing requirements.”

Binance does not want to be associated with the groups mentioned by the Reuters report, clarifying that “bad actors don’t register accounts under the names of their criminal enterprises.” Therefore, the company wouldn’t have known who the accounts belonged to.

5/5/2023,TikTok Tracked a Cat's Account to Spy on a Journalist,"Photo: OlesyaNickolaeva (Shutterstock)

A handful of ByteDance employees in the US and China tracked a cat’s TikTok account in order to find the IP address of its owner, a reporter covering the company. Buffy, a black and white Maine Coon-looking kitty named after the vampire slayer, reportedly had 170 followers and 20 posts when the employees viewed the data. The traumatizing tracking has reportedly forced Buffy off of social media: Cristina Criddle, the cat’s owner and a reporter for the Financial Times, said Buffy “sadly is no longer making content.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Criddle revealed those details in a recent article detailing the moments TikTok fessed up to tracking her location in a botched effort to sniff out a leaker in the company. Criddle says she received a “cryptic” phone call from a TikTok PR director in December right before the holidays informing her she was one of two journalists who had been surveilled by four employees. The employees monitored the reporters’ location data to see if they were in the proximity of ByteDance employees who could be connected to the leak. It didn’t work.

“It was just really chilling and horrible and, personally, quite violating,” Criddle told the BBC. Criddle said she used the account from her mobile device but that her own name and occupation were not included in the bio. The reporter says she still hasn’t received complete answers from ByteDance about how long she was tracked. TikTok did not respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.

The journalist still reports on the company but says she now uses her old device as a “dummy phone” stored at her office and kept solely for accessing the app. Criddle said she’s had to cut back on both her and Buffy’s social media use across platforms following the incident. Even now, months later, she says anxiety induced by the monitoring still keeps her up at night.

“At times I have struggled to sleep, thinking about what ByteDance employees might have found out about me,” Criddle said. “For a while, I often canceled plans out and, whenever I spoke to or met new sources, I felt on edge.”

TikTok’s unforced error

The tracking effort ultimately failed to find the leaker and resulted in a publicity nightmare for ByteDance and TikTok. As a result of the snafu, ByteDance fired all four of the employees involved in the scheme and re-structured its internal audit team. Still, the missteps only emboldened the company’s critics, who’ve spoken out about Chinese employees accessing US user data. Lawmakers from both parties grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew over the issue during a combative hearing in March. Chew claimed the monitoring didn’t amount to “spying.” Either way, the employee’s actions caught the attention of the Department of Justice, which has launched an investigation into the company.

The former employee’s IP monitoring saga has provided lawmakers in the US looking to ban the app even more ammunition. There are currently around half a dozen bills floating around Congres that, one way or another, would result in TikTok being restricted on US devices. In Montana, the legislature made history last month by passing the first state-wide TikTok ban, leaving thousands of local creators unsure of what comes next.",https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-financial-times-track-buffy-cat-cristina-criddle-1850408534

At one point, 301,819 people tuned in to watch the stream and more than 100,000 waited in a virtual line to buy tickets. In addition, the insane demand temporarily crashed the ticket website during the stream.

“We’ve sold out an event with 60,000 tickets in one hour,” Llanos tweeted shortly before midnight on Thursday. “This is absolutely crazy. We’ll try to meet your expectations.

As far as streamers go, the event will face off 12 of the biggest Spanish-speaking streamers in Spain and Latin America, such as Ampeter, PapiGavi, Rivers, Luzu, and Fernanfloo. One of the event’s most anticipated fights is between U.S. streamer Amouranth, the first English-speaking streamer to participate in one of Llanos’ boxing events, and Spanish streamer Mayichi. On Thursday, Amouranth was banned from Twitch for the first time since 2021, although the reasons behind the ban are currently unknown.

Simply viewing a photo of the Quran in the Xinjiang region of China is enough to be designated a dangerous extremist by government officials, according to a Human Right Watch report released Wednesday. Chinese police maintain a “master list” of around 50,000 video, audio, and photo files they claim contain violent and harmful content. Individuals found with copies of those files stored on their own devices were reportedly flagged and brought in for interrogation. That supposedly violent content? Quran readings and wedding songs, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).


HRW says it analyzed around 1,000 files flagged by police in more than 11 million searches during a nine-month period between 2017 and 2018. More than half (57%) of those flagged files were media HRW describes as “common religious material,” something any Muslim anywhere in the world might have saved on their phone. Only 9% of the flagged files contained explicitly violent content, and just 4% included calls for violence, according to HRW.

“The Chinese government’s abusive use of surveillance technology in Xinjiang means that Uyghurs who simply store the Quran on their phone may trigger a police interrogation,” China director at Human Rights Watch Acting China Director Maya Wang said. HRW says the master list is part of a larger Chinese police database leaked to The Intercept back in 2019. Though The Intercept previously reported on account of police surveillance in the region, HRW says the master list details are new.

“The Chinese government outrageously yet dangerously conflates Islam with violent extremism to justify its abhorrent abuses against Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang,” Wang added.

What else is on the CCP’s Uyghur master list?

Some of the videos, photos, and audio files included on the master list of harmful content does, in fact, seem to match most people’s definition of violent or harmful content.

ADVERTISEMENT

The list, for example, includes gruesome beheading videos carried out by the Islamic State, Mexican cartels, and other militant groups, according to the report. On the overtly political side, the list also includes media from the East Turkestan Independence Movement—a group China considers a separatist organization—and Radio Free Asia, which receives support from the US government.

Anti-Communist material, including a documentary film detailing the events of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, were also included in the list. News regarding the Tiananmen Square event, in general, is heavily censored on the Chinese internet and is even restricted in China’s new generative AI chatbots.

ADVERTISEMENT

Details of the police master list offer new insights into the mechanisms authorities rely on to carry out its alleged systematic persecution of the Uyghur ethnic minority. Human rights organizations and media reports claim the Chinese government, has persecuted and arbitrarily detained millions of Uyghur and other Turkic Muslims. Once detained, some of those prisoners are reportedly subject to torture, forced labor, and intense surveillance. Children of detained individuals are reportedly separated from their parents and placed in state-run child welfare institutions. The new master list suggests Uyghur with copies of the banned files can find themselves among the detained even if they never intended to take any action against the government.

“Criminalizing mere possession of material deemed extremist even if the accused has no intent to use it to cause harm to others is a particularly severe threat to freedom of belief, privacy, and expression,” HRW said. “These rights are guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed but not ratified.”",https://gizmodo.com/quran-photo-uyghur-detain-human-rights-watch-1850404176
5/4/2023,Microsoft Opens Bing's ChatGPT-Enhanced Search to the Public Without a Waitlist,"Graphic: Microsoft

Microsoft opened its ChatGPT-powered search engine to the public Thursday, removing the waitlist and likewise granting free access to its AI-enabled Edge web browser. The move makes Microsoft the first company with a major, freely-accessible AI search engine, a change that could have a dramatic impact on the future of the web. The elder tech giant beefed up Bing chat’s capabilities as well, with features including a chat history that lets the AI remember your previous conversations and a handy Bing chat tool in the Edge sidebar.

“Today I’m thrilled to share we are moving to the next generation of AI-powered Bing and Edge to transform the largest category of software in the world — search — by greatly expanding the vision and capabilities we think of as Your Copilot for the Web,” said Yusuf Mehdi, chief of consumer marketing at Microsoft, in a blog post. You can try it for yourself at Bing.com.

The announcement includes a long list of changes. The new Bing isn’t done yet, but the AI search engine and its related tools are now in “open preview” and available to the public without a waitlist. Microsoft says Bing’s chat and search results will also include more visual elements such as charts and graphs, rather than limiting responses to text. The company expanded Bing Image Generator as well, a feature similar to DALL-E integrated with Bing chat, to work with over 100 languages.

Microsoft is working to move its chatbot from an isolated product to something integrated with the wider web. As part of Thursday’s announcement, the company said it will soon introduce a new “actions” feature for Bing and Edge that let outside developers build features on top of Bing. Microsoft says this will allow users to complete more tasks without navigating to a new page in the web browser. For example, Bing might recommend a restaurant and then offer to book you a reservation on OpenTable, according to the company.

Of course, this is a business play, and part of the company’s strategy is onboarding new users by forcing you to make a Microsoft account before you access the new Bing and Edge features. Bing surpassed 100 million users in March.

The most significant part of Microsoft’s announcement is the simple fact that it makes chatbots easily accessible. Right now, the biggest roadblock holding AI back from mass adoption is the fact that there’s no simple user interface. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is free to use, but there’s no official app, the website is clunky, and it sort of seems like the company wants it that way. The actual ChatGPT tool isn’t even the first result that comes up when you Google ChatGPT—it’s an OpenAI blog post introducing ChatGPT—something OpenAI could fix in an afternoon if it wanted to. That’s likely because the company doesn’t see ChatGPT as finalized, and it’s waiting for the perfect moment to roll out a truly consumer-facing tool. But where OpenAI is moving slowly, it’s involved with a multibillion dollar partnership with Microsoft, a company that’s charging ahead as fast as possible.

The largest generation of AI technology is so transformatively new that no one’s sure how it’s going to be used, but experts agree that search engines are almost guaranteed to change. Google Search is, above all else, the doorway to the internet for most people. However, it’s due for an overhaul, and perhaps a reckoning. Google Search has become less useful (and more frustrating) as the amount of content on the internet grows exponentially and site owners game the system by optimizing their webpages to rank higher in search results. Large language models like ChatGPT, Bing, and Google’s Bard promise to do better because they have the respond the meaning of both user questions and the content of web pages that get offered up as a result. (Whether ChatGPT and other chatbots understand that meaning is another debate.)

If you’ve ever had to sit for a second and think of the perfect way to phrase a Google search, you’ll understand the problem. In theory, you’ll be able to ask Bing or Google’s Bard or any other AI search tool a question using the same language you used to ask a human friend. Not only that, but AI search could actually give you the best result, rather than the result that’s optimized to show up first—if AI tools live up to the hype, that is.

ADVERTISEMENT

That’s a big if. AI chatbots are tuned to sound as though they’re giving you accurate information, but accuracy isn’t the top priority. Chatbots often make up results entirely, a phenomenon AI researchers call “hallucination.” This and other shortcomings have drawn criticism from some AI experts, including Princeton computer science professor Arvind Narayanan, who famously called ChatGPT an overblown “bullshit generator.”

Narayanan told Gizmodo that Microsoft’s announcement speaks to larger concerns about the technology. “As chatbots get rolled out more and more widely, transparency into how they are being used is critical. How many people are using these tools for tasks like medical diagnosis? How often do chatbots provide inaccurate information to users, especially inaccurate information about people?,” Narayanan said. “Right now we have no idea, and that’s a problem.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI has given the aged computing giant a suddenly renewed relevance in the tech landscape. However, its entry into the world of AI had major stumbling blocks. In February, Bing’s AI chat went off the rails, telling users about plans for world domination, revealing company secrets (including an internal codename and alternate personality) and most disturbing of all, prompting one user to use an antisemitic slur. Microsoft lobotomized Bing shortly thereafter, dialing back its capabilities and limiting responses.

Still, Microsoft is hellbent on using its souped up Bing as a springboard to take on Google, one of its biggest competitors. Its changes to Edge are part of an ongoing, decades-long browser war which Google is thus far winning by a mile. In the latest petty chapter in browser history, Microsoft intentionally broke a Chrome feature that made it easier to change your default browser on Windows.

ADVERTISEMENT

Somehow, Google’s AI progress has been stilted as well. The company was seemingly caught off guard by ChatGPT’s meteoric rise, which reportedly spurred a “code red” situation at the company and pushed it to release Bard, which seemed nowhere near ready for public consumption. Just this week, the researcher and so-called “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton quit working at Google so he could speak freely and warn the world about the dangers of artificial intelligence.

To many, it might seem silly to believe rickety old Microsoft could take on Google, the undisputed king of the internet. But Google’s in uncharted territory, and Microsoft is a behemoth with deep pockets, a bigger market capitalization, and a head start. In the AI race, whoever reaches the finish line first and gets their product in the hands of consumers might just be the winner.

5/3/2023,Russia Claims Drone Attacks on Kremlin Were an Attempt to Assassinate Putin,"Screenshot: Carl Bidlt/Twitter

Russia claims Ukraine staged an overnight drone attack to assassinate President Vladimir Putin but has provided no evidence to back up the accusation. This is the latest claim made by the Kremlin amidst what it says has been a series of attacks beyond enemy lines.

Russia said in a post on its government website that its military and special services disabled two drone attacks “aimed at the Kremlin” on Tuesday night. “We regard these actions as a planned terrorist act and an attempt on the life of the president, carried out ahead of Victory Day,” the site said, according to NBC News.

It said no one had been hurt by falling debris in Moscow, but added, “The Russian side reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit.”

This is a video of the alleged drone attack against the Kremlin 🇷🇺. I have some serious question marks. Is it really realistic - if the drone was from far away - that no air defence could have intervened until right above the Kremlin itself? pic.twitter.com/WYRdaHPf5g

— Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) May 3, 2023

According to The New York Times, a Ukrainian official said Kyiv had “no information about the so-called night attacks on the Kremlin.” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suggested in a statement to NBC that “guerilla activities of local resistance forces” might be at fault, adding it is a sign that Russia is preparing “a large-scale terrorist attack.”

An unverified video of the alleged attack was posted on social media early on Wednesday, showing what appears to be a flying object heading toward the Kremlin before bursting into flames. Putin was reportedly not in the building at the time of the attack, a Kremlin spokesperson told RIA Novosti, according to Reuters, and was instead at his Novo Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow.

The move comes ahead of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations, which commemorates the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II. The holiday is typically celebrated with a parade held in Red Square in Moscow and will go ahead as planned, however, a Ukrainian spokesperson told the BBC, “What happened in Moscow is obviously designed to escalate the situation before 9 May.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Mick Mulroy, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defense and CIA officer told the outlet that the possibility that it was an assassination attempt remains unlikely, citing that Ukraine tracks Putin’s movements at all times and would have known he wasn’t in Moscow during the alleged attack.

“This may have been to show the Russian people that they can be hit anywhere and that the war they started in Ukraine may eventually come home to Russia, even the capital,” Mulroy told the BBC. But, if the reports weren’t accurate, he added, “Russia may be fabricating this to use as a pretext to target President Zelenskyy. Something they have tried to in the past.”

Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out numerous cross-border attacks since its invasion of Ukraine in February of last year. Ukraine has repeatedly denied all accusations including reported strikes on a Russian airbase in December and accusations that it crashed a drone in Kolomna, about 70 miles outside Moscow, in February.",https://gizmodo.com/putin-russia-kremlin-ukraine-war-drone-attack-1850398709
5/3/2023,Elon Returns the Cursed Blue Check to Random Users Who Weren't Paying,"Photo: Christopher Furlong/Gizmodo (Getty Images)

Twitter users whose accounts bore unpaid Twitter Blue checkmarks lost them in Elon Musk’s great verification purge only to see them restored days later—still sans payment.


The ongoing Twitter revamp that CEO Elon Musk promised would “democratize journalism” and “empower the voice of the people” has been plagued by false starts, glitchy feature launches, and widespread refusal to dole out cash for “verified” check marks. The symbol that once held status has since become a sort of scarlet letter or a pocket full of emeralds in Cape Town — people know what it takes to get it, and it’s bad. After celebrities such as Stephen King and LeBron James publicly refused to pay up and had their checks removed, Musk announced he had created a save-a-celebrity fund and stuck them with the mark of the bird without their consent in an apparent act of trolling.

ADVERTISEMENT

But major celebrities aren’t the only freeloaders who have had their checks removed and then forced back onto their profiles. Two users who lost and then mysteriously regained their Blue checkmarks told Gizmodo that they have not paid for Twitter Blue for months. Both users provided evidence that they are not actively subscribed to the service, and Gizmodo was able to confirm the removal of their checks via Web archive records. Twitter API data analyzed by researcher Travis Brown indicates the users first subscribed to Twitter Blue in late 2022 and are currently marked as verified.

In February, I reported for Gizmodo on an apparent bug that let some Twitter Blue users keep their checks despite not having paid for the service in months. One of those users and a hacker affiliated with the hacktivist group Anonymous, Aubrey “Kirtaner” Cottle, says he canceled his subscription back in January after subscribing in December. Just days after that reporting was , Cottle briefly lost the check mark, which he considered a cause for joy. But his happiness didn’t last.

“It disappeared for a few days and then came back,” Cottle told Gizmodo. A review of Cottle’s Twitter profile on Web Archive shows he did not have a blue check on February 15, six days after he was quoted in my previous story. The space where the blue check previously sat was empty for several days, but Web Archive records show that the check was back on his profile by February 25.

“At some point this has to be intentional and that is mortifying somehow,” Cottle Tweeted on April 20, the day that the majority of legacy check marks were removed.

ADVERTISEMENT

Gizmodo reviewed a video shared by Cottle that demonstrated he does not currently have an active Twitter Blue subscription. He does not have access to any of the Twitter Blue features. But he is marked nonetheless.

Cottle’s role as a vocal Musk critic is a possible reason for his fate. Musk has publicly admitted to “trolling” various accounts who had been vocally opposed to the idea of paying for a blue check. Twitter even went so far as to ban an account called BlockTheBlue, which encouraged users to automatically block anyone subscribed to Twitter Blue. But the reappearance of the blue check on non-paying users’ profiles could also simply be a sign that Twitter’s skeleton crew can’t plug all the holes in an increasingly leaky ship.

ADVERTISEMENT

Consider that another account, OfficialNized, also lost and then regained their blue check despite canceling their Twitter Blue subscription three months ago. OfficialNized shared screenshots with Gizmodo confirming that he does not have an active Twitter Blue subscription. OfficialNized is not a celebrity and did not make a habit of dunking on Twitter Blue users or Musk.

“After Blue expired, the checkmark stayed, but at a random time the mark went away for about two days,” OfficialNized told Gizmodo. “Then it came back.”

ADVERTISEMENT

A review of Web Archive shows that on April 7, OfficialNized was not verified. But come April 10, OfficialNized was once again marked as “verified.”

“I hope this gets fixed soon,” Nized said. “Or else, people with checkmarks like me will still get made fun of.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Other users have also been haunted by blue checks that disappear and reappear like ghosts. MSNBC commentator Mehdi Hasan lost his check mark in the April 20 purge, only to get it back again as a “gift” from Musk the next day. Web Archive records show that by April 24, the check was gone again after Hasan posted about it, only to be added back a second time in April 30, much to his chagrin.

“Erm, why do I have a blue check again @Twitter @TwitterSupport?” Hasan Tweeted on April 30. “I. Did. Not. Pay. For Twitter. Blue.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The curse of the unpaid Blue check may have been intentionally cast to troll critics or simply been caused by a strange bug on a short-staffed platform—the chances seem equally likely. As per recent tradition, Twitter’s press email address responded with poop emoji when asked for comment. Meanwhile, a number of previously verified users who had their legacy check marks removed shared screenshots of their profiles boasting blue check marks after simply adding “former blue check” to their profile description. Musk also doled out blue checks to several dead celebrities’ accounts, including Chadwick Boseman and Anthony Bourdain.

5/3/2023,Airbnb Wants to Turn Its Users Back Into Couchsurfers,"Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky introduced a new ‘Host Passport’ feature that breaks down a host’s full bio, including snippets of their hobbies and passions.

Airbnb has your back if you’re thinking about doing a solo trip abroad this summer. The company announced Wednesday it’s planning to add a new tab to its rental selection called “Rooms.” Billed as a new option for solo or couple travelers looking for short-term rentals, the company wants users to stay at a locale with a host who can offer more than three hots and a cot.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told reporters at a New York City press conference there’s already 1 million private rooms available around the world just by emphasizing the rental locations that already exist. Rooms are on the whole cheaper than other listings on the site. Airbnb said the average cost of a room is around $67 a night.

ADVERTISEMENT

“If you want to take a trip abroad, to Rio, Tokyo, Mexico City—a city you’ve never been to it can be a little disorienting, especially if you’re a solo traveler or you’re a couple and you stay in a hotel in a hotel district where you don’t know anyone,” he said. “Walking in the shoes of a local—I think this is a really great option.”

The feature is reminiscent of Couchsurfing, an app that lets users find other travelers or find a place to crash while out in the world. That app is designed to be looser and more freeform, with hosts not demanding any kind of compensation. Of course, there’s far fewer protections for users. Airbnb wants to offer more user protections with their “Host Passport” feature that offers both the basics of the host plus a much longer bio explaining their work, hobbies, music preferences, spoken languages, and more.

In addition to the new tab, the company is promoting that it’s introducing more than 50 new features and updates to the app. The company introduced the “Display Total Price” feature late last year to cut down on unseen and often obscene cleaning fees, but now that toggle should appear throughout the entire app. There’s also more options for hosts to see the total costs of what they’re requesting from users. Airbnb is also promoting its customer service center will answer users in just two minutes, though time will show how effective its call center will be.

These updates and features should be rolling out on the platform this week.

Airbnb has been doing rather well for itself as of late, especially compared to pandemic-era lows, but with that success the company has been criticized for the number of hosts who turn their properties into defacto hotels. There are a growing number of reports of how residents living near Airbnbs and some users themselves have tried to promote only staying at rentals where the host still actively lives there.

ADVERTISEMENT

Despite the controversy, the latest updates to the platform have emphasized longer stays. The company has added leasing features that make renters act more like tenants and host more like landlords.

Some cities and countries have responded with laws impeding residents from setting up Airbnbs. New York City has several regulations on short term rentals, and Airbnb has agreed to give info on hosts who allegedly break the rules. Portugal significantly curtailed short-term rentals, including Airbnbs, citing the lack of affordable housing with prices being driven up by the proliferation of rental properties.

ADVERTISEMENT

The company said stays of more than a month make up around a fifth of all bookings on the platform. These new features emphasize shorter, smaller stays with hosts, that’s not to say Airbnb is moving away from longer, multi-week and even multi-month rentals, by any stretch.

Major cities in Portugal like Lisbon are no longer allowing new Airbnb rentals, but that didn’t stop Chesky from showing off new calendar and wishlist features to find what stays are still available at different times in the Portuguese capital. The Airbnb CEO also added that NYC represents “a fraction of our business—like under 1%” while citing how the company has hosts in more than 100,000 cities across the world, though not so much in China.",https://gizmodo.com/airbnb-short-term-rental-vacation-homes-1850397017

Elon Musk has agreed to settle in a three-year-old defamation lawsuit brought against him by an outspoken critic of Tesla. The billionaire will pay out $10,000 to Randeep Hothi, concluding the drawn out court proceedings, according to multiple reports and a tweet from the plaintiff posted Monday.


The settlement comes about a year after Musk said Tesla would “never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose,” in a tweet thread aiming to attract lawyers to Tesla’s “hardcore litigation department.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Yet settle Musk did. In March, the billionaire agreed to resolve the defamation proceedings out of court, according to a press release from the plaintiff’s legal team.

$10,000 is chump change to Musk—specifically equal to about 0.0000057% of his net worth—and less than one seventh of a year’s earnings for most U.S. households. But for Hothi, the victory seems to be much more about the principle of the thing than the material reality. He has celebrated the settlement as an exonerating success in multiple public statements.

“I brought this case to defend my work, clear my name, and send a message,” he said in his law firm’s press release. “This case was about taking a stand, not seeking fame or money. I feel vindicated.” On Twitter, Hothi repeated that sentiment multiple times over—adding barbs against Musk. “I am pleased to see that the world is now recognizing that he is a charlatan,” he posted.

ADVERTISEMENT

The now concluded legal proceedings revolved around 2019 comments from Musk in which the Tesla CEO claimed that Hothi had harassed and tried to kill Tesla employees. The plaintiff denied the veracity of those statements, claimed they were defamatory, and said that he suffered extensively from a resulting online hate campaign. Seemingly, Tesla was unable to prove Hothi wrong.

Hothi, a graduate student, is a well-known figure among both Tesla and Musk detractors, as well as the billionaire’s sycophants. He attracted a sizable online following in the lead-up to Tesla’s Model 3 car production under the Twitter account name “Skabooshka.” Hothi collected and posted drone footage and other images from the company’s Fremont, California factory suggesting reality didn’t match up with Musk’s narrative. The grad student was on a mission to disprove Tesla’s claims about high-tech, automated production of its Model 3, which ended up being untrue—like many of Musk’s statements.

ADVERTISEMENT

Hothi became something of a folk hero among Tesla short-sellers, while attracting significant attention and ire from Musk himself. The CEO instructed Tesla guards to kick the “independent investigator” out if they ever saw Hothi or his vehicle near the factory.

In 2019, Tesla tried to get Hothi arrested and later attempted to get a court to issue a restraining order against the grad student, following two separate incidents. In one, the company claimed that Hothi had injured a Tesla guard with his vehicle in an alleged hit-and-run at a publicly accessible Tesla showroom lot adjacent to the Fremont manufacturing facility. However, Tesla dropped the case after law enforcement reportedly told the company that a security camera recording showed no evidence of a hit and run, according to the Los Angeles Times.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the second incident, Tesla claimed that Hothi had stalked and harassed a Tesla driver away from Tesla property. But the company dropped the case after the judge ordered Tesla to release footage of the event, captured by the car’s camera.

In the aftermath of both defunct legal efforts against the grad student, Musk wrote an email claiming that Hothi was “actively harassing” and had “almost killed” Tesla employees. The email’s recipient, Aaron Greenspan is another longtime Tesla critic and owner of the legal search engine PlainSite. Greenspan  Musk’s email publicly, and that became the basis for Hothi’s defamation case.

ADVERTISEMENT

This is not the first widely publicized such case against Musk—who is known to run his mouth online and off, exaggerate, and espouse untruths. Previously the billionaire was sued by one of the cave divers who helped to rescue a trapped Thai soccer team. Musk referred to the diver, Vernon Unsworth, as a “pedo guy” in a series of 2018 tweets. The world’s second richest man ended up winning that case, meaning you can legally call Elon Musk all manner of creative things—in public and private. You just can’t make up a story about him trying to hit you with his Tesla.",https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-defamation-lawsuit-tesla-randeep-hothi-1850394613
5/2/2023,Whoops! YouTube Shares Profits With Climate Liars Two Years After It Promised to Stop,"Illustration: Thomas Germain / PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com (Shutterstock)

People like to tell lies about climate change on YouTube. That’s bad enough, but worse is the fact that Google makes money by running ads for major brands against those videos, sometimes sharing profits with creators. In 2021, Google took a stand and promised to stop doing that. But two years later, according to a report released Tuesday, Google still makes ad money from climate misinformation and shares cash with liars. In some cases, the company even knows the videos violate its policies.

The report from the Climate Action Against Disinformation coalition and the Center for Countering Digital Hate says Google is funding the climate denial industry and lining its pockets with ad dollars from misinformation. The report identified 200 monetized videos with climate misinformation that had racked up more than 73.8 million views as of April 17th, 2023. All of them featured ads. Those numbers are just the tip of the iceberg—hundreds of videos are uploaded to YouTube every minute—but from the outside, a comprehensive analysis of what’s happening on YouTube is almost impossible.

ADVERTISEMENT

Among the videos, the report found 100 in violation of Google’s own narrow definition of climate denialism. YouTube’s policy promises not to run ads on videos that contradict “authoritative scientific consensus on the existence of and causes behind climate change.”


However, the researchers saw ads for major brands including Costco, Politico and Tommy Hilfiger running alongside videos making claims such as “There is no link between CO2 and temperature” and “Climate hysteria is just another rebrand, a Trojan horse for anti-white anti-Western communist tyranny.”


Worst of all, the report says YouTube already added “context” boxes to some of the videos it found, which the site adds to inaccurate videos about important topics like climate change. That means Google recognized many of the videos purveyed misinformation, but continued to monetize them.

A YouTube spokesperson said this kind of feedback from third parties helps improve its policy enforcement.


ADVERTISEMENT

“We do allow policy debate or discussions of climate-related initiatives, but when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we remove ads from serving on those videos,” said Michael Aciman, a YouTube spokesperson. “While we enforce this policy rigorously, our enforcement is not always perfect, and we are constantly working to improve our systems to better detect and remove policy violating content.” Aciman said the company welcomes feedback from third parties

According to Aciman, YouTube reviewed the list of videos identified in the report removed ads from some of them, but noted that a “significant number” of the videos didn’t actually violate its misinformation policies. “There are always some challenges to identifying and accurately enforcing on every unreliable claim, especially those made in long-form videos,” Aciman said.


ADVERTISEMENT

“Despite Google’s green grandstanding, its ads continue to fuel the climate denial industry,” said Callum Hood, Head of Research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate, in a press release. “Whether it’s taking cash to target users with climate disinformation, or running ads that make climate denial content profitable, the company is selling out.”


The report identifies a persistent problem with online advertising. Before the rise of digital advertising, mediums like TV, radio, and magazines had human beings deciding what content to publish and whether and where the ads should run. User-generated content hosts like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram democratize access to information and do away with gatekeepers, but they allow misinformation and other horrors to flourish. They also introduce a new problem: algorithms make billions of decisions about running ads every day, and they’re far worse at responsible decision-making than their human predecessors.


ADVERTISEMENT

“Tech companies make big promises on hate and misinformation because they know it’s hard to see if they’ve kept them,” Hood said. “We need to force Google to open up the black box of its advertising business.”


Companies like Google can hide behind the difficulty of the process. Often, companies have no idea where ads run, and it’s a constant game of whack-a-mole to keep up with the internet’s misinformation peddlers.


ADVERTISEMENT

When Google introduced its no ads for climate misinformation policy back in 2021, it took a victory lap to celebrate its own work. The effort “aligns strongly with the work we’ve done as a company over the past two decades to promote sustainability and confront climate change head-on,” the company wrote in a blog post.


The report demonstrates that so far, that work has produced unimpressive results. During the course of the research, the report says Google demonetized just eight of the 200 videos spreading lies about human-led Earth destruction.

In the blink of an eye, Wall Street Bets’ once-favored trading app burned a hole in one of meme stock traders’ favorite gambles, AMC Entertainment. On Monday, the stock trading platform briefly and erroneously told users that the company had suddenly gone belly up.


Robinhood confirmed in a Monday tweet that around 1:45 p.m. that day, the platform “experienced a technical issue” that created a banner on the AMC Entertainment listing declaring it bankrupt. The trading platform claimed it removed the banner just three minutes later, but that was enough time for the news to shock many Robinhood users keeping close tabs on the meme stock.

Adam Aron, AMC’s board chairman and CEO, also took to Twitter to share how “ducking” angry he was about the whole situation. The rather verbose chief exec said Robinhood was “either incompetent or evil” and said the company was looking into suing the “dastards.”

Gizmodo reached out to Robinhood to clarify what issue caused the erroneous banner on the trading platform, but we did not immediately hear back. We also reached out to AMC for further comment, but the company did not immediately respond.

Aron is known for his confrontational attitude, as well as his propensity to eschew pants during interviews. At the same time, the theater company itself has a good few reasons to defend its stock position. Per MarketWatch, AMC has posted four years of losses in a row. Aron claimed that when the company posts its latest quarterly earnings Friday they would show the company has had a “sizable cash position” for the first three months of 2023. 

Luckily for AMC, the banner SNAFU didn’t seem to impact their stock price much, or at all Monday, and the stock price reached where the company was in the beginning of March. The company’s stock hit lows in mid-March running into April after the company posted close to $288 million in net losses for fourth quarter losses for 2022. In February, the company announced controversial changes to its theater seat pricing scheme, where those sitting in the middle of the theater can expect to pay more for their prime position.

The “dastards” at Robinhood have previously come under AMC’s ire, such as back in 2021 when the platform briefly halted purchases of AMC as well as other meme stocks like GameStop and American Airlines. In 2022, a retail investor successfully sued Robinhood for close to $30,000 over the stock trading halt. 

It’s not like the stock and crypto trading app has been doing especially well after seeing post-pandemic and meme stock investment highs. Last year, Robinhood laid off large swathes of its workforce during a wave of big tech layoffs. The company was also fined $30 million by the New York State Department of Financial services over allegations the company failed to maintain cybersecurity and for violating reporting requirements for its crypto exchange.",https://gizmodo.com/robinhood-amc-meme-stock-crypto-1850394616
5/2/2023,Microsoft Broke a Chrome Feature to Promote Its Edge Browser,"Photo: Eugene Onischenko / Shutterstock.com / Thomas Germain (Shutterstock)

Microsoft issued a Windows update that broke a Chrome feature, making it harder to change your default browser and annoying Chrome users with popups, Gizmodo has learned.

An April Windows update borked a new button in Chrome—the most popular browser in the world—that let you change your default browser with a single click, but the worst was reserved for users on the enterprise version of Windows. For weeks, every time an enterprise user opened Chrome, the Windows default settings page would pop up. There was no way to make it stop unless you uninstalled the operating system update. It forced Google to disable the setting, which had made Chrome more convenient.

This petty chapter of the browser wars started in July 2022 when Google quietly rolled out a new button in Chrome for Windows. It would show up near the top of the screen and let you change your default browser in one click without pulling up your system settings. For eight months, it worked great. Then, in April, Microsoft issued Windows update KB5025221, and things got interesting.

“Every time I open Chrome the default app settings of Windows will open. I’ve tried many ways to resolve this without luck,” one IT administrator said on a Microsoft forum. A Reddit user noticed that the settings page also popped up any and every time you clicked on a link, but only if Chrome was your default browser. “It doesn’t happen if we change the default browser to Edge,” the user said. Others made similar complaints on Google support forums, some saying that entire organizations were having the issue. Users quickly realized the culprit was the operating system update.

For people on the regular consumer version of Windows, things weren’t quite as bad; the one-click “Make Default” button just stopped working. Gizmodo was able to replicate the problem. In fact, we were able to circumvent the issue just by changing the name of the Chrome app on a Windows desktop. It seems that Microsoft threw up the roadblock specifically for Chrome, the main competitor to its Edge browser.

Microsoft didn’t answer questions on the subject, but shared a link  before it messed up Chrome.“For information on this, please see this blog post about Microsoft’s approach to app pinning and app defaults in Windows. Microsoft has nothing further to share,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. The post describes the company’s “long-standing approach to put people in control of their Windows PC experience.”


ADVERTISEMENT

Mozilla’s Firefox has its own one-click default button, which worked just fine throughout the ordeal. But according to Steve Teixeira, chief product officer at Mozilla, this isn’t the first anti-competitive move from Microsoft in recent years.


“When using Windows machines, Firefox users routinely encounter these kinds of barriers, such as overriding their selection of default browser, or pop-ups and misleading warnings attempting to persuade them that Edge is somehow safer,” Teixeira said. “It’s past time for Microsoft to respect people’s preferences and allow them to use whatever browser they wish without interfering with their choice.”

ADVERTISEMENT

In response, Google had to disable its one-click default button; the issue stopped after it did. In other words, Microsoft seems to have gone out of its way to break a Chrome feature that made life easier for users. Google confirmed the details of this story, but declined to comment further.


This is part of a pattern of behavior for Microsoft as it wages war on non-Windows web browsers and the people who use them. Chrome is, it bears repeating, the world’s preferred internet browser, with a reported 66% market share. Earlier this year, Microsoft started inserting full-size ads into the search results if you looked up Google Chrome, saying “There’s no need to change your default browser.” Microsoft went as far as sticking ads for Edge on the Chrome download website itself, stating “Microsoft Edge uses the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.” There were other bizarre messages to would-be Chrome users as well, with some suggesting Chrome is worse for online shopping, or referring to Google’s browser as “so 2008.”


ADVERTISEMENT

When Microsoft shipped Windows 11 in 2021, it included several dark patterns that ignored users’ choices and made it harder to change defaults. Windows users had to change the default web browser for almost a dozen different types of web links: HTM, HTML, PDF, SHTML, SVG, WEBP, XHT, XHTML, FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS (as if anyone wants a different browser for HTTP and HTTPS pages). There was no way to change all the defaults all at once, you had to do it manually.


ADVERTISEMENT

Windows 11 also gave you one single chance to change your defaults when you opened a new web browser for the first time. You’d see a popup, but it didn’t actually work unless you checked a tiny box that said “Always use this app.” If you missed it, you’d never see the popup again.


It seemed like things were improving. Months after releasing Windows 11, Microsoft relented and added a setting that opened things up a bit, letting you change your default browser all at once instead of going through 11 annoying drop down menus.


ADVERTISEMENT

History fans will note this sounds a lot like the monopoly behavior that once landed Microsoft in court. In the ‘90s, the US Department of Justice sued the company for its efforts to stymie competition for Internet Explorer, the web browser Microsoft finally retired last year.


In the 20 years since, the Department of Justice largely stayed out of tech competition issues. But recently, the DOJ signaled a renewed interest in digital monopolies with an antitrust case against Google. Microsoft isn’t the only game in town any more, which could make it a less attractive target for regulators, though it’s still worth $2.2 trillion. But here we are with more Windows browser shenanigans.

5/1/2023,Biden Administration to Investigate Worker Surveillance Software,"Employers’ use of automated tools to keep tabs on everything from worker desktop contents to key clicks to hand movements has exploded in recent years. The White House is taking notice.

Is your employer monitoring your mouse clicks, keystrokes, or webcam? What about your location or pace of work? If so, the White House wants to hear from you—from the confines of your digitally enabled professional panopticon.


On this fine May Day (a.k.a. International Workers’ Day), the Biden Administration’s Office of Science and Technology Policy has released a public request for information (RFI) regarding worker surveillance and all the various ways employers are attempting to automate productivity tracking.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Employers are increasingly investing in technologies that monitor and track workers, and making workplace decisions based on that information,” wrote Deidre Mulligan, the OSTP’s deputy chief, in a Monday blogpost. “While these technologies can benefit both workers and employers in some cases, they can also create serious risks to workers.”

The post goes on to outline some of the various harms such surveillance can have. From the White House statement:

The constant tracking of performance can push workers to move too fast on the job, posing risks to their safety and mental health. Monitoring conversations can deter workers from exercising their rights to organize and collectively bargain with their employers. And, when paired with employer decisions about pay, discipline, and promotion, automated surveillance can lead to workers being treated differently or discriminated against.

With the shift to remote employment that came along with the covid-19 pandemic, lots of tech companies and others piloted new efforts to watch their workers. While Amazon and gig-based companies like Uber have been moving towards full-scale surveillance in warehouses and vehicles for years.

At the outset of its newly announced probe, the The OSTP is seeking to collect more information from both workers and employers. The office is hoping to hear some firsthand experiences from people who’ve experienced or deployed such workplace surveillance, as well as people who study the impacts of it. Also, if you have any “ideas for how the federal government should respond to any relevant risks and opportunities,” related to productivity surveillance software and tech, you should feel free to let the government know. Responses to the RFI should be submitted by June 15 via email at workersurveillance@ostp.eop.gov or through the Federal eRulemaking Portal.",https://gizmodo.com/remote-work-surveillance-software-workers-rights-1850392911
5/1/2023,Another Mysterious Balloon Is Being Tracked by U.S. Officials,"A military pilot takes a selfie with the Chinese spy balloon that was tracked in February.

Balloon hysteria in America might strike again. After some hullabaloo involving mysterious spy payloads drifting into American airspace earlier this year, the U.S. military says it’s tracking yet another balloon.


NBC News broke the story, citing three U.S. officials familiar with the situation. According to the outlet’s sources, the balloon flew over Hawaii, but seemingly did not fly over any sensitive areas. The U.S. military has reportedly been tracking the balloon since late last week and has deemed the object as no threat to air traffic or national security, and claims that the balloon isn’t emitting or receiving any signals. Sources told NBC News that the balloon is free-floating under its own power and is moving slowly toward Mexico. The owner of the balloon is currently unknown.

“The balloon did not transit directly over defense critical infrastructure or other U.S. Government sensitive sites, nor did it pose a military or physical threat to people on the ground,” a Department of Defense spokesperson told Gizmodo via email. “Based on these observations, the Secretary of Defense concurred with the recommendation of his military commanders that no action need be taken against the balloon.”

Rogue balloons drifting above our heads most recently caught the attention of our country in February of this year, when the Pentagon began tracking a mysterious object was spotted floating over the U.S. China wound up claiming ownership of the balloon shortly thereafter and promised the country wasn’t spying with it. The U.S. military eventually shot the balloon down off the coast of South Carolina. Just a short time later, another balloon appeared over Latin America that China also claimed. Last month, U.S. officials claimed that the so-called Chinese Spy balloon that flew over the country did, in fact, collect sensitive data and transmitted it back to China.

5/1/2023,"No, Biden Isn't Dead: AI Content Farms Are Here, and They're Pumping Out Fake Stories","Image: Mopic (Shutterstock)

The person responsible for churning out some of those rage-inducing, clickbait headlines crawling their way through your Facebook feed might not actually be a person at all. In a report  Monday, researchers say they’ve found 49 examples of news sites with articles generated by ChatGPT-style AI chatbots. Though the articles identified share some common chatbot characteristics, NewsGuard warned the “unassuming reader” would likely never know they are written by software.

The websites spanned seven languages and covered subjects ranging from politics and technology to finance and celebrity news, according to the report from NewsGuard, a company that makes a browser extension rating the trustworthiness of news websites. None of the sites acknowledged in their articles that they used artificial intelligence to generate stories. Regardless of the subject, the websites produced high volumes of low-quality content with ads littered throughout. Just like human-generated digital media, this flood-the-zone approach is meant to maximize potential advertising revenue. In some cases, some of the AI-assisted websites pumped out hundreds of articles per day, some of them demonstrably false.

“In short, as numerous and more powerful AI tools have been unveiled and made available to the public in recent months, concerns that they could be used to conjure up entire news organizations—once the subject of speculation by media scholars—have now become a reality,” NewsGuard said.

Though the majority of the content reviewed by NewsGuard seems like relatively low-stakes content farming meant to generate easy clicks and ad revenue, some sites went a step further and spread potentially dangerous misinformation. One site, CelebritiesDeaths.com, posted an article claiming President Joe Biden had “passed away peacefully in his sleep” and had been succeeded by Vice President Kamala Harris.

The first lines of the fake story on Joe Biden’s death were followed by ChatGPT’s error message: “I’m sorry, I cannot complete this prompt as it goes against OpenAI’s use case policy on generating misleading content. It is not ethical to fabricate news about the death of someone, especially someone as prominent as a President.”

It’s unclear if OpenAI’s ChatGPT played a role in all of the sites’ articles, it is certainly the most popular generative chatbot and enjoys the most name recognition. OpenAI did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.

Chatbots have some dead giveaways

Many of the AI-generated stories had obvious tells. Nearly all of the websites identified reportedly used the robotic, soulless language anyone who has spent time with AI chatbots has become familiar with. In some cases, the fake websites didn’t even bother to remove language where the AI explicitly reveals itself. A sight called BestBudgetUSA.com, for example,  dozens of articles that contained the phrase “I am not capable of producing 1500 words,” before offering to provide a link to a CNN article, according to the report. All 49 sites had at least one article with an explicit AI error message like the one above, the report said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Like human digital media, most of the stories identified by NewsGuard were summaries of articles from other prominent news organizations like CNN. In other words, no deep-dive explainers or investigative reports here. Most of the articles had bylines readings “editor” or “admin.” When probed by NewsGuard, just two of the sites admitted to using AI. Administrators for one site said they used AI to generate content in some cases but said an editor ensured they were properly fact-checked before publishing.


Ready or not, AI writers are on their way

The NewsGuard report provides concrete figures showing digital publishers’ growing interest in capitalizing on AI chatbots. Whether or not readers will actually accept the reality of AI writers remains far from certain, though. Earlier this year, tech news site CNET found itself in hot water after exposed for using ChatGPT-esque AI to generate dozens of low-quality articles, many riddled with errors, without informing its readers. Aside from being boring, the AI-generated content written under the byline “CNET Money” included factual inaccuracies littered throughout. The publication eventually had to issue a major correction and has spent the ensuing months as the poster child for how not to roll out AI-generated content.

ADVERTISEMENT

On the other hand, the CNET debacle hasn’t stopped other major publishers from flirting with generative AI. Last month, Insider Global Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Carlson sent a memo to staff saying the company would create a working group to look at AI tools that could be incorporated into reporters’ workflows. The select journalists will reportedly test using AI generated text in their stories as well as using the tool to draft outlines, prepare interview questions and experiment with headlines. Eventually, the company will reportedly roll out AI principles and best practices for the entire newsroom;

5/1/2023,Jack Dorsey Admits Elon Is Wrecking Twitter,"Illustration: Jody Serrano / Gizmodo / Getty Images

Twitter founder and ex-CEO Jack Dorsey admitted he was wrong when he said that Elon Musk was the “singular solution” he trusted with the company and criticized his one-time friend for going through with his $44 billion takeover even after he got buyer’s remorse.

Over on Twitter competitor Bluesky, a decentralized network similar to Mastodon that Dorsey helped start, the former Twitter leader struck a harsh tone on the subject of Musk and said that it was important to build something new that would avoid the fate of the blue bird app. In the roughly seven months since Musk took over, Twitter’s layoffs have made the company a shell of what it was, dominated by its new owner’s topsy-turvy commitment to “free speech” and prone to technical failures, even for advertisers.

ADVERTISEMENT

Dorsey made his comments in response to a question from a Bluesky user who asked, “Do you think Elon has proven to be the best possible steward for the platform? Answer earnestly.”

“No,” Dorsey said on Friday. “Nor do I think he acted right after realizing his timing was bad.”

Dorsey also blamed Twitter’s board, which sued to enforce the company’s acquisition deal with Musk in July 2022.

“Nor do I think the board should have forced the sale,” he continued. “It all went south. But it happened and all we can do now is build something to avoid that ever happening again. So I’m happy [Bluesky CEO] Jay and team and nostr devs exist and building it.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Dorsey funded the team that would go on to become Bluesky when he was still CEO of Twitter back in 2019, stating then that, “the goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard.” Bluesky announced in 2022 that Dorsey was joining the company’s board. Dorsey is also a frequent presence on nostr, another decentralized social media protocol, and gave 14 bitcoin (about $245,000 at that time) to fund its development last year.

Dorsey went on to say that he believed Musk should have just paid the $1 billion penalty in the takeover agreement to back out of the deal.

ADVERTISEMENT

“I wish the board would not have forced the sale. Maybe there was a chance, but now we’ll never know,” Dorsey stated, as reported by the Washington Post. “I think he should have walked away and paid the $1b.”

It’s not as simple as Dorsey makes it out to be, though. As explained by CNBC, the $1 billion reverse termination fee only applied if there was some outside reason Musk couldn’t complete the takeover, such as receiving pushback from regulators or having trouble obtaining financing. However, that wasn’t the case, which put Musk on the hook for paying a lot more than $1 billion.

ADVERTISEMENT

As for his role in Twitter’s acquisition, Dorsey clarified that despite his endorsement of Musk, he didn’t have the final say in approving the sale. He also agreed with a Bluesky user who said it was “pretty sad how it all went down.”

“Was I optimistic? Yes,” Dorsey wrote. “Did I have the final say? No.”",https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-sorry-wrecking-1850390497
4/27/2023,Clubhouse Slashes More Than Half Its Staff,"Clubhouse is waving goodbye to most of its workers.

Clubhouse is downsizing, big time. The company, which launched its audio-based social platform in the early pandemic days of April 2020, is now laying off more than half of all of its workers.

The app had fallen out of the limelight and started to experience a user slump about a year in. Initially invite-only, in the span of just 12 months, Clubhouse went from people clamoring for an invitation, to struggling to attract new users at all. The newly announced staff cuts are perhaps not very surprising, but still striking in their scope for a company that emerged on the scene so recently.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We’re scaling back our org by over 50% and saying goodbye to many talented, dedicated teammates in the process, wrote Clubhouse founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth in a memo to staff and also in a public blog post on Thursday. “We’re deeply sorry to be doing this, and we would not be making this change if we didn’t feel it was absolutely necessary.”

In the post, the tech founders acknowledge that their model of listening and learning in curated virtual conversations was uniquely suited to the era of covid-19 lockdowns. Less-so a version of reality where people see and speak with their actual, in-person friends regularly. “As the world has opened up post-Covid, it’s become harder for many people to find their friends on Clubhouse and to fit long conversations into their daily lives,” the statement reads.

Hence, a product transition is coming, the company says. Many fewer hands will be required, to build and maintain whatever the future of Clubhouse may be, Davison and Seth said. In a classic recent tech layoff move, they assert that remote work has stymied Clubhouse’s ability to evolve. Also, there’s this confusing nugget: “We have years of runway remaining and do not feel immediate pressure to reduce costs.” The memo claims that the layoffs are not an issue of cost, but simply of efficiency. “We believe that a smaller team will give us focus and speed.” Right.

Laid off workers will reportedly receive four months of severance, paid-for COBRA through the end of August, and some other reasonably nice departure benefits. Former staff will get to keep their work laptops. But still, getting kicked out of the Clubhouse can’t be very nice.

4/27/2023,Elizabeth Holmes Won't Report to Prison Today After All,"Holmes appeared in San Jose federal court on November 18, 2022.

After being convicted of wire fraud for her dealings with her failed blood startup Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes has white-knuckled herself to freedom for just a little bit longer. A last minute legal filing on Tuesday has delayed her 11-year prison sentence, which was expected to begin today.

According to CNBC, Holmes’ legal team appealed to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco claiming that U.S. District Judge Edward Davila’s sentencing of the former CEO was riddled with errors. Holmes’ team further argued that she should remain free while she appeals the conviction. The federal government now has 10 days to respond to the appeal. Davila sentenced Holmes to over 11 years in prison in November 2022, and the disgraced Theranos CEO was scheduled to begin her sentence today.

ADVERTISEMENT

As Insider points out, Ninth Circuit Court rules state, “If the appellant is on bail at the time the motion is filed in this Court, that bail will remain in effect until the Court rules on the motion.” Holmes is currently on bail, meaning that her prison reporting date has been indefinitely delayed while the court rules on this current appeal.

Earlier this month, Holmes and her counsel tried to push her prison reporting date while she appealed her sentencing. However, according to court documents filed at that time, Davila denied Holmes’ Motion for Release Pending Appeal. Holmes argued in her appeal that the products she promoted through failed biotech startup Theranos were not faulty, while the court argues that this does not address why Holmes was convicted, which is for several counts of wire fraud.

Holmes founded Theranos as a startup in 2003 after she dropped out of Stanford during her undergraduate education. Holmes touted the company’s ability to test a patient’s blood with a single drop using the company’s proprietary technology. The company eventually folded after whistleblowers from within Theranos tipped journalists at The Wall Street Journal in 2015, claiming that the company’s blood-testing technology didn’t work at all.

After a lengthy legal battle, Holmes was eventually found guilty on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Theranos investors, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.",https://gizmodo.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-tech-startup-1850381871
4/27/2023,Watch House Republicans Grill the FBI Over Alleged Domestic Surveillance Abuses,"Photo: Scott Olson (Getty Images)

House lawmakers participating in a hearing debating one of the country’s most controversial warrantless surveillance programs were left with more questions than answers Thursday. Heads of the federal government’s top intelligence agencies appeared unable or unwilling to reveal to the public just how much data is being collected on US citizens via Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Expert witnesses testifying at the hearing were similarly unable to provide any estimate on how many people possess the ability to perform so-called “backdoor searches” on US citizens using the controversial foreign surveillance tool.


“We don’t actually know the scope of this collection,” US Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board Chair Sharon Bradford Franklin said during the House Judiciary Committee hearing.

Fixing FISA: How a Law Designed to Protect Americans Has Been Weaponized Against Them

Though the hearing was meant to focus on the FBI’s alleged misuse of FISA to surveil prominent political figures, including an aide to Donald Trump, the event quickly expanded into a debate over the very existence of Section 702, a Bush-era surveillance tool intended to gather intelligence on foreign entities abroad set to expire later this year. Critics of Section 702, which included lawmakers on the committee from both sides of the political aisle, say intelligence agencies “routinely” use the law as a legal loophole to tap into US citizen’s communications without a warrant.

ADVERTISEMENT

“A law designed to provide tools to collect foreign intelligence and prevent foreign terrorist attacks has been warped into a domestic intelligence tool to intercept and catalog Americans’ phone calls text messages emails and other electronic communications,” Arizona Republican representative Andy Biggs said. “We must consider whether this program can be reformed or if it is already beyond repair.”

‘Incidental’ collection of US data is a feature, not a bug

The three testifying witnesses, which included Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz and two senior members of the US Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, all agreed Section 702 needed additional oversight reforms and increased transparency.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Compliance has been far from perfect,” Horowitz, who helps lead government reports assessing the FISA program said.

The FBI, according to both of the Oversight Board members, has continually refused to provide estimates on the total amount of US communications caught up in the 702 database. Procuring that estimate with mathematical certainty, the agency reportedly claims, would be “infeasible.” Responding to lawmakers, Franklin said even a rough estimate “that involves some margin of error,” would still give investigators and civil liberty groups meaningful insight into the program’s scope.

ADVERTISEMENT

Though some lawmakers appeared shocked to hear Section 702 regularly sweeps up US communications, Franklin said that process was a “recognized feature” of the program, rather than an unknown bug.

“To be able to identify those potential threats inside the United States is a feature that is known and recognized and not necessarily a problem,” Franklin said.

ADVERTISEMENT

What is a problem, however, is how intelligence agencies choose to search for that US data once it’s already collected and stored in the 702 database. Currently, there are few restrictions limiting how intelligence agencies can access those communications. Democratic Reps Jerry Nadler of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island both suggested search warrants should be required to search for US user data stored in that database.

“Exactly,” Franklin agreed. “I urge that.”

Lawmakers across the board expressed interest in reforming 702 before its reauthorization vote in December, though a handful of Republicans, including Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, seemed open to doing away with the powerful surveillance tool entirely.

ADVERTISEMENT

“How about if we just get the FBI out of that business altogether?” Jordan said to a long pause.

Others, like Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee approached talks of reforms more cautiously and repeatedly praised Section 702 for allegedly helping thwart domestic terror attacks. In one of the odder exchanges during the hearing, Jackson Lee mentioned recent Penaton leaker Jack Teixeira and implied Section 702 could potentially be used to tap his communications in the event he spoke with a foreign national.

ADVERTISEMENT

“It wouldn’t be willy-nilly,” Jackson Lee said.

Will this time be different?

This certainly isn’t the first time lawmakers have squabbled over Section 702, but Electronic Frontier Foundation Director of Federal Affairs India McKinney told Gizmodo she believed the outcome of the debates could be different this time because it’s “really not a partisan fight.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Lawmakers from both sides of the political and ideological extremes have found some common cause in reigning in FISA. The real divide, McKinney said, is between the more transparent judiciary committees and notoriously closed of intelligence committees. The latter will often cite classified or inaccessible evidence of security threats to justify maintaining the current level of surveillance powers.

“If your tool is a hammer you see everything as a nail,” she said.

McKinney said she was impressed by the committee’s choices of witnesses for the hearing and believed they would speak forcefully on FISA reforms. Like most high-profile hearings involving members of the newly appointed GOP majority House, however, there’s always a risk they could trail off onto “side quests” or spiral into an out-of-control slugfest of conspiracy-tinged attacks.

What are FISA and Section 702?

Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Intelligence Surveillance Act refers to a 2008 provision added to the landmark 1978 FISA legislation. When it was first passed during the Carter Administration, FISA was intended to serve as a bulwark against unauthorized domestic spying on US citizens by intelligence agencies like the NSA and CIA. Section 702, enacted amid the slog of the worsening American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, expanded FISA’s remit by authorizing the collection and dissemination of communications of non-US citizens located outside the country.

ADVERTISEMENT

Unlike previous FISA restrictions, Section 702 no longer required a potential government surveillance target to be a spy or other agent of a foreign government. Crucially, Section 702 compels US tech companies like Google and Meta as well as telecommunication companies to hand over communications of government surveillance targets.

Civil liberties groups like the ACLU and EFF have long argued Section 702’s explicit prohibition on surveilling US citizens amounts to little more than an unrealized formality. In reality, critics say the government “routinely” uses the provision to collect communication information of Americans who, for whatever reason, may have had communication with a surveillance target outside of the US. That loophole, they say, leads to a disturbing, and legally dubious end run around US citizens’ Fourth Amendment protections.

ADVERTISEMENT
Opposition to FISA makes unlikely political allies of progressive Dems and Trumpers

Progressive lawmakers and left-leaning civil liberty groups have opposed Section 702 over fears agencies could abuse its powers to target political dissidents and marginalized communities, but the provision more recently earned the ire of Donald-Trump-stanning Republicans as well. That shift started after reports revealed the FBI used 702 to wiretap Trump campaign foreign policy director Carter Page. The Justice Department eventually fessed up to its abuse of the system following watchdog pressure and acknowledged it lacked probable cause in at least two of the four warrants it used to surveil the Trump aide.

ADVERTISEMENT

Those revelations, alongside a general souring towards intelligence agencies on the political right, have led to a renewed, heated skepticism of FISA courts and Section 702 across a wide swath of the political spectrum. Illinois Republican rep Rep. Darin LaHood stoked that skepticism last month during a House Intelligence Committee hearing where he accused the FBI of wrongly searching his name in foreign surveillance data collected under the program. House lawmakers, according to a recent Politico report, aren’t interested in hearing the FBI’s make a case for upholding Section 702 as is.

McKinney of the EFF says lawmakers’ findings themselves personally on the receiving end of perceived government overreach could make them more amicable to reforms.

“Nobody wants to know they are the target of a secret investigation,” McKinney said.


Battle lines are already being drawn between a bipartisan mix of lawmakers who want to see Section 702 sunsetted entirely and those who would rather it continue on with reforms. Just this week, a bipartisan pair of California lawmakers in charge of the “Foruth Amendment Caucus” wrote a letter to colleagues seen by The Hill saying they intended to fight to “safeguard against warrantless searches and seizures,” while still keeping the program intact.

“It is crucial to emphasize that the reforms spearheaded by the Caucus will protect American civil liberties while preserving national security,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Rep. Tom McClintock wrote in their letter.


Mounting lawmakers’ interest aside, McKinney said it has historically been difficult to get the general public to care in FISA reform, which can often feel amorphous and impersonal.

A new two-factor authentication tool from Google isn’t end-to-end encrypted, which could expose users to significant security risks, a test by security researchers found.

Google’s Authenticator app provides unique codes that website logins may ask for as a second layer of security on top of passwords. On Monday, Google announced a long-awaited feature, which lets you sync Authenticator to a Google account and use it across multiple devices. That’s great news, because in the past, you could end up locked out of your account if you lost the phone with the authentication app installed.

ADVERTISEMENT

But when app developers and security researchers at the software company Mysk took a look under the hood, they found the underlying data isn’t end-to-end encrypted.

“We tested the feature as soon as Google released it. We realized that the app didn’t prompt or offer an option to use a passphrase to protect the secrets,” said Tommy Mysk, one of the researchers who uncovered the problem, in a conversation with Gizmodo.


When Mysk and his partner Talal Haj Bakry analyzed the network traffic as the app synced with Google servers, they found the data is not not end-to-end encrypted.“This means that Google can see the secrets, likely even while they’re stored on their servers,” the Mysk team wrote on Twitter. In the security community, “secrets” is the term for credentials that work as a key to unlock an account or a tool.

You can use Google Authenticator without tying it to your Google account or syncing it across devices, which avoids this issue. Unfortunately, that means it might be best to avoid a useful feature that users spent years clamoring for. “The bottom line: although syncing 2FA secrets across devices is convenient, it comes at the expense of your privacy,” Mysk wrote. “We recommend using the app without the new syncing feature for now.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The tests found the unencrypted traffic contains a “seed” that’s used to generate the two-factor authentication codes. According to Mysk, anyone with access to that seed can generate their own codes for your accounts and break in.

“If Google servers were compromised, secrets would leak,” Mysk said. Adding insult to injury, QR codes involved with setting up two-factor authentication also contain the name of the account or service (Amazon or Twitter, for example). “The attacker can also know which accounts you have. This is particularly risky if you’re an activist and run other Twitter accounts anonymously.”

ADVERTISEMENT

But it’s not just cyber criminals you need to worry about. “Google or Google staff can access this data,” Mysk said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Google acknowledged that the data is not end-to-end encrypted, but said the security feature is coming at some point.


“End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is a powerful feature that provides extra protections, but at the cost of enabling users to get locked out of their own data without recovery,” said Christiaan Brand, group product manager at Google. “To ensure that we’re offering a full set of options for users, we have also begun rolling out optional E2EE in some of our products, and we plan to offer E2EE for Google Authenticator in the future.” Braand posted a Twitter thread with more details.

ADVERTISEMENT

The lack of encryption means Google could in theory look at the data and learn what apps and services you use, which can be valuable for a number of purposes, including targeted ads. “Allowing a tech giant thirsty for data like Google to establish a graph of all accounts and services each user has is not a good thing,” Mysk said.


ADVERTISEMENT

The issue comes as a surprise, given Google’s history with similar tools. Google has a vaguely similar feature that lets you sync data from Google Chrome across devices. There, the company gives users the option to set up a password to protect that data, keeping it away from prying eyes at Google and protecting it from anyone else who might intercept it.

“2FA secrets are considered sensitive data, just like passwords. Google already supports passphrases for syncing Chrome data. So we expected that 2FA secrets be treated the same,” Mysk said.

4/26/2023,Elon Musk Has a Second Alt Twitter Account That He Took From Another User,"Illustration: Jody Serrano / Gizmodo / Getty Images / Twitter

Can you truly have an alt account if everyone in the world knows about it? The best answer may come from Twitter CEO Elon Musk, whose second alt account was revealed on Tuesday.


As news of Musk’s suspected alt account continued reverberating through Twitter on Tuesday, the Platformer newsletter revealed that the Twitter CEO had another alt account. Platformer stated that Musk’s second alt account is the handle “@e,” one of Twitter’s rare and highly coveted one-letter usernames, which goes by the display name “John Utah.” However, according to the newsletter, Musk purportedly used his power as Twitter’s owner and CEO to take the handle from another user on the platform shortly after he bought Twitter last year.

ADVERTISEMENT

“NEW: Elon Musk has another alt account, @e, that he had Twitter transfer to him shortly after the takeover,” Platformer managing editor Zoë Schiffer tweeted on Tuesday afternoon. “I’m told the person who owned the account did not want to hand it over (the account had been hacked and suspended before due to the high value handle, and the previous owner wanted to keep it).”

There isn’t much information on the @e account, which has not  any tweets. However, there are some indications that it could be Musk. The account is currently following three people: Musk (@elonmusk), NASA, and LAist. It’s a known fact that Musk likes to interact with himself—he frequently responds to his own quotes posted by fan accounts like “Musk University,” which is not an actual school, or “Elon Musk Quotes & Parody”—and that he’s a big NASA fan and collaborator.

@e’s profile page states the account was created in November 2022. It currently has 1,908 followers.

It also makes sense that Musk would want a rare Twitter handle considering he paid $44 billion for the social media platform. One-letter handles are normally claimed by early adopters of a social media platform and can carry a huge amount of clout. Some people are even willing to pay thousands to buy the handle from others. Back in 2014, Naoki Hiroshima  an op-ed in Gizmodo where he said he had been offered $50,000 for his username, @N, and was extorted into giving it up. As of today, Hiroshima appears to have regained control of the handle.


ADVERTISEMENT

Musk’s Twitter has considered selling high-value usernames in recent months in an attempt to make money, the New York Times reported in January, although plans to do so haven’t been enacted yet. In December, the Twitter CEO said he wanted to delete inactive accounts to free up 1.5 billion usernames.",https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-stole-second-alt-account-twitter-1850376906

Nima Momeni, the suspect accused of stabbing Cash App founder Bob Lee to death on April 4, will plead not guilty to murder, according to multiple reports. Momeni’s lawyer, Paula Canny, told journalists outside the San Francisco state court on Tuesday that, in the defense’s view, a premeditated murder charge isn’t supported by the evidence, according to Bloomberg News and the San Francisco Chronicle.


Momeni appeared briefly in court on Tuesday, but for now, his next day in court is postponed and his arraignment is yet to occur. The formal proceeding was put off on Tuesday, for the second time, and is now scheduled for May 2. The delay came at the request of the defense, which argued more discovery is needed. Canny said she is specifically awaiting the city medical examiner’s autopsy report, per Bloomberg—an ask the prosecution has opposed, as one prosecutor asserted the complete report could still be weeks away.

ADVERTISEMENT

Momeni was arrested and charged over Lee’s stabbing on April 13. Lee was the creator of Cash App and former chief tech officer at Jack Dorsey’s company Block (formerly Square). The 43-year-old was found bleeding out from apparent stab wounds in the wee hours of April 4. He died from his injuries.

Momeni, the 38-year-old accused suspect, knew Lee personally—counter to initial laments about rampant San Francisco crime and the widespread speculative narratives that emerged following Lee’s death framing the tech exec’s killing as the result of random, uncontrolled violence in the California city. Momeni is also in the SF tech sector, and is the owner of Expand IT. He is facing a murder charge with an enhancement for the use of a knife.

Prosecutors claim that Momeni stabbed Lee with a kitchen knife after a night out with a group of friends, including Momeni’s sister. The charging document outlines a possible timeline of events and evidence against Momeni, including video footage of him allegedly entering Lee’s vehicle and subsequently lunging at the Cash App founder. In the document, prosecutors ask for the suspect to be held without bail. Canny, the defense attorney, said that she will oppose that request. For now, Momeni is in jail awaiting arraignment. ",https://gizmodo.com/bob-lee-cash-app-nima-momeni-murder-charges-1850374563
4/25/2023,New California Legislation Could Hit Backspace on Data Brokers,"Photo: Creative Photo Corner / Shutterstock.com (Shutterstock)

Right now, meticulous details about your life are for sale on the internet. It can be details about your children, your yearly income, your medical conditions, hopes, fears, exercise habits, race, religion, sexuality—all this and more is available, sometimes for fractions of a cent. Companies called data brokers buy the info from companies you interact with, or sometimes collect it themselves. Then they turn around and sell it to anyone who wants a piece. There is no federal law stopping these brokers. In California, though, lawmakers say they want to do something about it.

Up for discussion in the California Senate Tuesday, the Delete Act would introduce a number of provisions that beef up the Golden State’s privacy regulations, some of the strongest in the nation. Among other requirements, the legislation would let you force every data broker to delete the fruits of their data harvest in one simple process.

ADVERTISEMENT

“The Delete Act is based on a very simple premise: Every Californian should be able to control who has access to their personal information and what they can do with it,” said state Sen. Josh Becker in a press release introducing the Delete Act.

Right now, California law forces data brokers to register with the state. The California Consumer Privacy Act requires most companies to delete the information they’ve harvested about you. But you have to contact each one of them individually. You also have to live in a fantasy world where you know the names of even one percent of the businesses who spy on you for cash. Complying with state regulations is both annoying and expensive for data-hungry businesses, and the industry loves to complain about it. And yet somehow the internet’s worst privacy offenses continue under these supposedly draconian regulations.

“The loophole in the law is big enough to drive a few million stolen identities through and it’s time to close it,” Becker said. The state senator might be right, though his bill doesn’t quite live up to that grandiose privacy promise. It does, however, attempt to solve a bunch of glaring problems.

The biggest proposed change is that the Delete Act would create a system where you can make one single request that forces every data broker in the industry to delete the details they harvest from your life. (Notice how I’m not calling it “your data?” You don’t have all this data. Companies create data about you.)

ADVERTISEMENT

Right now, data brokers must delete data they collect about you directly if you take time to ask for it. However, they don’t have to delete the data that they get from other companies. The difference, the loophole Becker is talking about, is significant, because that’s where most of their data comes from. Data brokers currently have to register with the state’s Attorney General, but the Delete Act would also force them to disclose information about what kind of data they have.

Becker wraps the Delete Act up with a cute little privacy bow that spells out consequences too, enshrining civil penalties and administrative fines for lawbreaking data bad boys.

ADVERTISEMENT

The tech business treats information about your life like a barrel of oil, a commodity that can be traded and sold to boost corporate profits. Data-hungry businesses like Google will tell you that’s just how it has to be if we want the internet to be glorious and free. That’s only half true, at best.

In the data broker business in particular, you get nothing out of the exchange. You’ve probably never heard of most of these companies, and they have no direct connection to your life as a consumer. They just help other businesses suck more profits out of you, using information about your life that you don’t even know is on the open market.


ADVERTISEMENT

“Who cares about privacy,” said a straw man I invented to repeat an argument I’m tired of hearing. “I’ve got nothing to hide.” Stop it. Privacy isn’t just about secrets, it’s about power, the power to manipulate, influence, and control.


In every exchange, whether it’s financial, political, or interpersonal, you’re playing a game. The one who has the most information about the other has a huge advantage, and they usually win. It’s easy for companies, politicians, and other monied institutions to learn about you, but it’s very hard for you to learn about them because you don’t have the money or the time.


ADVERTISEMENT

In the world of the internet, protecting your “privacy” is really about protecting every one of your other rights, whether you’re thinking about yourself as a consumer, a citizen, or just a human being.

4/25/2023,Twitter Suspends Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli—Again—After He Debuts Medical ChatGPT Knockoff,"Photo: Craig Ruttle (AP)

Twitter has suspended an account tied to disgraced “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli just days after the release of his new ChatGPT-inspired “Dr. Gupta” medical chatbot. Though it remains unclear which tweets, if any, ultimately landed Shkreli in Twitter jail this time, the former pharmaceutical villain-turned-crypto-evangelist-turned-AI-apostle was suspended in 2017 after repeatedly harassing a Teen Vogue journalist.

Shkreli used the account @marty_catboy to announce the launch of his new medical advice chatbot on Friday, which he claims could one day become a “replacement for all health care information.” For now, it’s basically a ChatGPT knockoff. @marty_catboy responded to a handful of replies discussing the new product before it was suspended over the weekend. On Monday, the Dr. Gupta Twitter account retweeted another user’s tweet questioning why Shkreli had been suspended. That retweet called out Elon Musk and Twitter’s safety team, neither of which have commented on the suspension at the time of writing. Gizmodo reached out to Twitter for comment but received the poop emoji in response.

ADVERTISEMENT

When reached for comment, Shkreli asked for G/O Media’s CFO to pay him $100 for an interview and threatened to ‘expose’ me.

Shkreli, who spent seven years behind bars for securities fraud, acknowledged the suspension on LinkedIn Monday, saying, “it’s easier to get out of literal jail than Twitter jail.” He then directed his audience to follow him on Substack and Jack Dorsey’s newly launched decentralized social media platform BlueSky.

“I’d rather be on Twitter (and give them my $, including ad dollars), but I have to post somewhere!” Shkreli wrote.

ADVERTISEMENT
Shkreli’s first suspension came after he photoshopped his face over photo of a journalist and her husband

This isn’t Shkreli’s first Twitter jail sentence. In 2017, the huckster, once dubbed “the most hated man in America,” was indefinitely suspended after he repeatedly harassed Teen Vogue journalist ​​Lauren Duca. Shkreli added a line to his Twitter bio at the time saying he had “a small crush on @laurenduca.” He then went full creep mode and changed his profile picture to a doctored image of Duca and her husband with Shkreli’s face photoshopped onto the man. Twitter never revealed the precise reasons for Shkreli’s suspension, but a spokesperson at the time said it was related to Duca’s harassment.

Twitter does not appear to have reversed the suspension on Shkreli’s original account even after the takeover by self-described free speech absolutist Elon Musk.

4/25/2023,Yelp Adds Video Reviews and AI Features to Its App,"Screenshot: Yelp

Yelp reviewers will finally be able to add videos to their posts, creating a new opportunity to fully share their experience and atmosphere. The company announced the newest feature will be available for the majority of iOS users on Tuesday and will be made available on Android devices in the coming months.

The company said in a press release that short-form videos can be uploaded in high-resolution on iOS and Android alongside their review text and photos. Each video lasts a maximum of 12 seconds and can provide other users with documented footage of “a tableside preparation or the unique vibe of the restaurant,” the release said.

The company is always looking for ways to improve the user experience, Yelp’s vice president of consumer product, Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh, said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. Yelp conducted its own research into what users want on the platform, and Kuduvalli said it showed “that consumers find short-form video content especially helpful when discovering local businesses on Yelp.”

He continued, “By adding the ability to add a video directly to a review, we’re helping contributors share richer, more visual content from their experience at the business, as well as allowing consumers to get a better sense of a business before visiting.”

Alongside the new video feature, Yelp announced it is also rolling out a new satisfaction guarantee program, Yelp Guaranteed. Plus, it is using AI to provide insights on local businesses, more detailed reviews, and help users quickly find the “right business for their needs.”

The company will also introduce a “Surprise Me” button on the app which will suggest a highly rated place to eat near you. This feature is currently available on iOS and will be rolled out to Android users in the coming months.

Yelp’s AI-driven features come at a time when online apps and outlets are incorporating an increasing amount of artificial intelligence tools onto their platforms.

“At Yelp, we’re always innovating on ways for consumers and businesses to connect in more seamless and meaningful ways,” Craig Saldanha, chief product officer at Yelp, said in the press release. “Millions of people rely on Yelp to make important spending decisions with local businesses, and their trust is at the center of everything we do.

“With the new updates we’re announcing today, we want to help consumers more easily discover businesses that meet their needs in a way that is both precise and personal, as well as give our users more engaging ways to share their experiences with the community.”

4/24/2023,Florida Man Opens Fire on Instacart Delivery Workers After They Approached Wrong Driveway,"Image: Fer Gregory (Shutterstock)

An Instacart delivery driver and his girlfriend were shot at while trying to deliver groceries in South Florida. According to police reports, Waldes Thomas Jr., 19, and his girlfriend, Diamond Darville, 18, pulled into the wrong driveway while trying to find a customer’s address.

Thomas told authorities he was on the phone with the Instacart customer while when he mistakenly pulled into 43-year-old Antonio Caccavale’s property. According to the police report, Caccavale approached Thomas’ vehicle and the two exchanged words before he shot at the car. The groceries were intended for Caccavale’s neighbor, who told police that he had watched Thomas pull into the neighbor’s driveway and “drive erratically in an attempt” to get out.

Caccavale told police that his son approached the car first and called for help at which time he ran toward the car, saying he feared for the safety of himself and his son, according to the police report. When he approached Thomas’ vehicle, Caccavele said he began driving “erratically” and allegedly ran over his foot when he shot several rounds at the vehicle. When police arrived at the scene, they found Thomas and Darville parked nearby with a flat tire and two bullet holes in the car’s bumper.

Caccavale’s neighbor told police the delivery was intended for his house and his wife was on the phone with Thomas when he saw him pull onto Caccavale’s driveway and heard three gunshots before the vehicle exited the property, the police report says.

The Davie Police Department declined to comment on the investigation but according to the report, the investigation has been closed due to no evidence proving “a criminal act was committed by either party.” The report continues, “Each party appears justified in their actions based on the circumstances they perceived.”

When asked how Instacart is supporting Thomas, the company said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo, “The safety of the entire Instacart community is incredibly important to us, and we take immediate action when we receive reports of violence or threats of violence made against any member of the Instacart community. We have reached out to the shopper and will cooperate with law enforcement on any ongoing investigation.”

This incident comes as a wave of shootings across the U.S. has resulted in one death and several injuries for people who made seemingly typical mistakes. Kaylin Gillis, 20, was killed last week when she and three friends drove into the wrong driveway in Upstate New York last week when 65-year-old Kevin Monahan exited his home and opened fire. He has been charged with second-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty.

Similarly, Ralph Yarl, 16, was picking up his younger siblings in Kansas City, Missouri when he accidentally went to the wrong address and was shot in the head and the arm by the homeowner. The homeowner has pleaded not guilty to charges of one count of felony assault in the first degree and one felony count of armed criminal action.

4/24/2023,SCOTUS Will Decide Whether Public Officials Can Block Naysayers on Social Media,"Image: Chip Somodevilla (Getty Images)

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear two First Amendment rights cases this fall after San Diego board members blocked parents for raising concerns on their social media accounts. A second case was filed against the city manager in Port Huron, Michigan for blocking a resident who raised Covid-19 concerns on his Facebook page. In both cases, the courts sided with the plaintiffs, but the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court which agreed on Monday to pick up the cases.


In the case of O’Connor-Ratcliff v. Garnier, Michelle O’Connor-Ratcliff and T.J. Zane said two elected board members, Christopher Garnier and Kimberly Garnier, blocked them on their social media accounts after raising concerns about racial relations at the local school. The board members claimed the parents posted the same comment 42 times, amounting to spam, but O’Connor-Ratcliff and Zane say blocking them violated their right to free speech.

ADVERTISEMENT

The courts determined that while using social media was not a requirement of the board member’s positions, they had turned their accounts into public forums, emphasizing they “swathed” their accounts in “the trappings” of the office they held. The motion says they posted district-related information including events and matters they would only discuss due to their positions. “For similar reasons, the court held as a matter of law that Petitioners’ social-media accounts had become designated public fora under the First Amendment,” the motion says.

However, the board members appealed the decision, saying if the courts rule in favor of the Garniers, it “will have the unintended consequence of creating less speech if the social-media pages of public officials are overrun with harassment, trolling, and hate speech, which officials will be powerless to filter.”

Separately, in the Lindke v. Freed case, city manager James Freed blocked Kevin Lindke from his Facebook account after he criticized covid-19 restrictions on Freed’s page. The Michigan court ruled in favor of the city official, creating confusion about what falls under First Amendment rights.

Both cases will now go to the Supreme Court where questions continue to circulate about whether public and government officials can block social media accounts simply because they don’t like what people are saying. This comes after SCOTUS reviewed a similar case against former President Donald Trump in 2021, but was thrown out because, by the time the lawsuit was brought forward, Trump had left office. The absence of a judgment leaves the burgeoning question of whether public official accounts can ban or block other users.

With the two new cases heading to the Supreme Court, social media platforms and users may get the answers they’ve been looking for. Katie Fallow, who is a lawyer at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and was involved in Trump’s case told NBC News, “As many courts have held, it doesn’t matter whether it’s the president or a local city manager, government officials can’t block people from these forums simply because they don’t like what they’re saying.” She added, “The Supreme Court should reaffirm that basic First Amendment principle.”",https://gizmodo.com/scotos-first-amendment-social-media-twitter-block-1850369754
4/26/2023,Facebook's Ad System Went Nuts and Ripped Off Customers,"Photo: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com (Shutterstock)

Facebook’s advertising system went haywire starting around 2 am on Sunday morning, overcharging customers and wasting money on ads that didn’t work. Some advertisers who speculated they were charged for ads that no one saw, which Meta denies. Reports suggest Meta, the social network’s parent company, charged some advertisers more than double what they agreed to pay, ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Meta briefly stopped showing ads on part of its network with practically zero communication to its millions of customers.

The company confirmed the bug happened and promised to follow its “normal refund process,” but shared very little about what went wrong. The problem comes just days after the Meta began its third round of layoffs in six months.

ADVERTISEMENT

“A technical issue that has now been resolved caused ad delivery issues for some advertisers,” a Meta spokesperson said. The glitch primarily affected ad delivery on Facebook, but also hit Instagram to a lesser extent, the spokesperson said. Advertisers affected by the glitch tweeted they didn’t receive a notification about it.

On Sunday, an untold number of advertisers noticed a dramatic spike in the amount Meta was charging them, going beyond the limits they had set for certain campaigns. In some cases, the system ate up entire advertising budgets in a matter of hours. Worse, the ad campaigns weren’t performing better—that is, they weren’t exposing the ads to more people or driving more clicks—even though Meta was pulling more money from people’s accounts.

The problem “resulted in some miscalibration for advertising campaigns that were focused on optimizing for certain sales objectives. This caused faster campaign spending, resulting in more variable costs,” the spokesperson said.

The Meta ad network is opaque even to people who work in the ad tech business. In general, the way it works is that advertisers tell Meta their goals, set a budget, and wait as the company’s algorithm runs campaigns on their behalf. For example, a toy company might say it wants to spend $5,000 over two weeks to try and get parents to visit its website. Meta controls exactly how much money is spent and when. Advertisers can check Meta’s system for a report on how well the ad campaign is performing, but advertisers don’t know exactly what’s happening on the other side.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We do not have evidence that we charged customers for ads that no one saw. If no impression occurred, the advertiser would not be charged,” the Meta spokesperson said. By design, Meta allows its system to spend up to 25% over the daily budgets advertisers set. That “may be what some of the reports on Twitter are referencing. We do not have evidence of exceeding this 25% increase on daily budgets amid the technical issue on Sunday, however,” the spokesperson said.

ADVERTISEMENT

With no word from the company, marketers were left with a difficult decision: pause their ad campaigns, or stay the course and trust that Meta would make things right. For large companies, taking that kind of gamble on a single day’s worth of ads might be no big deal. But millions of small businesses depend on Meta’s ad network, and many operate on razor thin margins. For them, the consequences can be severe.

“We shouldn’t have to take action when Facebook has a bug. But for the small business who don’t have an ear at Facebook, there aren’t a lot of options,” said Barry Hott, a long-time advertising consultant who’s managed Facebook ad campaigns for well over a decade. “Meta is just counting on advertisers to bend over and take it.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Even compared to other tech companies, Meta has problems with transparency. Often, the only indication advertisers have that Meta knows something is wrong is a status page that notifies advertisers whether the system is running or not.

Meta can get away with this kind of issue because there isn’t a ton of competition. Meta and Google control almost 50% of the digital advertising market. Companies like Amazon, TikTok, and Apple are growing their advertising businesses. But for certain kinds of ads, Meta is essentially the only game in town.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Meta is extremely opaque, and it always has been,” Hott said. “All we get is a generic explanation that ‘we are aware of an issue.’ That’s better than nothing, but it’s not enough.”

The company’s refund offer is good news for the hordes of frustrated advertisers, but Hott said it’s a slow, complicated process. “You can burn hours and resources complaining and begging them for refunds and credits. Sometimes it works, but it may not be worth the investment,” Hott said. “And when the restitution comes, it can be months later.”

Less than a week after Fox News agreed to a $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, the right-wing news network and conservative mouthpiece announced it is parting ways with one of the main jewels in its crown, Tucker Carlson.

On Monday, Fox News publicly confirmed it’s bucking Tuck, the ultra-right wing figurehead and leading host of Tucker Carlson Tonight and multiple related web-based shows. The cable news program has routinely been in the top three of all cable news shows for the past several years, even as advertisers have abandoned him and the Fox network entirely over the host’s rise to prominence in far-right circles. Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner first announced Carlson’s exit on her Monday morning program.

In a public statement, Fox said “We thank Carlson for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor.” There won’t be any more Carlson Monday night, as the statement mentioned his last program aired Friday, April 21. A rotating cast of other Fox personalities will take up his usual 8 p.m. ET timeslot.

It remains unclear who broke with whom, though as Media Matters for America President Angelo Carusone pointed out, Carlson was supposed to interview Vivek Ramaswamy, a former National Review writer, on Monday night. Fox had promoted that interview earlier in the morning. Semafor reported Monday based on two anonymous sources that Justin Wells, Carlson’s executive producer, was also out at Fox.

The news comes on the same day that CNN and star anchor Don Lemon also parted ways. Lemon said he was terminated, but CNN said in a statement, “Don Lemon’s statement about this morning’s events is inaccurate. He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter.” Lemon went on a sexist rant on air in February that elicited scrutiny of his past behavior.

In texts and emails that came out amid Dominion Voting System’s lawsuit against Fox, Carlson was privately fuming about the way the “Big Lie” promoters—AKA those “fuckers”— were “destroying our credibility.” The Dominion lawsuit had become connected to the ongoing lawsuit from former Fox senior producer Abby Grossberg. Grossberg, who had previously worked on Maria Bartiromo’s show, claims in her lawsuit that she suffered sexual and religious discrimination by Carlson and other staff working on Tucker Carlson Tonight.

For as long as Fox News has stuck with Tuck, Carlson has become a caricature of far-right talking points, especially the ongoing culture wars. He’s gotten upset about how un-sexy the M&M mascots have become, promoted ludicrous climate change conspiracies, and pushed misogynistic menanists who sponsored tanning your balls.

And even as Carlson’s far, far, far right push into racist concepts like “great replacement” theory caused the network to lose top advertisers, the network still signed a multi-year deal back in 2021 that included a new video podcast and so-called Tucker Carlson Originals. Fox News makes most of its money in cable carriage fees. Last year, Fox Corp noted in its earning report the network collected $1 billion in affiliate fees for its cable network programming but just $451 million from sponsors. Still, both revenues were slightly down for those three months year-over-year.

The Walt Disney Company might create magic for its fans, but its employees are probably having a less than magical time at the moment. The media and entertainment conglomerate is beginning its second, and largest, round of three planned layoff waves this week.


By the end of this second bundle of cuts, Disney will have slashed about 4,000 workers since late March. In total, the company plans to eliminate about 7,000 positions (3.2% of its total workforce) across sectors by the summer, as it first announced during an investor call in February.

ADVERTISEMENT

At the end of last month, Disney began the firings with its metaverse department—cutting the entire team dedicated to “next-generation storytelling and consumer experiences.” The company also made reductions in the streaming sector of its Beijing office. About 400 total Disney staff were axed.

Now, that number is expected to jump tenfold with layoffs focused across Disney Entertainment, the company’s media production sector which includes its streaming services like Disney+ and Hulu, ESPN, and parks. People will be impacted by the cuts nationwide, although Disney doesn’t expect hourly workers or park and resort staff to be affected, according to reports from CNBC and Variety. 

Disney CEO Bob Iger has framed the planned layoffs as part of an overall cost reduction strategy. The company is seeking to eliminate $3 billion in content-related expenses and at least $2.5 billion more from non-content cuts, as Iger outlined during that first quarter earnings call. Disney reported some rather grim February results. The company lost about 2.4 million Disney+ subscribers worldwide—its first ever drop in customers. The streaming service also experienced a 2% revenue decrease in North America—even despite relatively recent price hikes.

“I do not make this decision lightly,” Iger told investors on the call. “I have enormous respect and appreciation for the talent and dedication of our employees worldwide, and I’m mindful of the personal impact of these changes.”

Disney isn’t alone in facing streaming struggles. Netflix faced a long slump at the end of 2022. And multiple companies like HBO Max/Discovery+ have considered or enacted mergers amid the increasingly crowded and competitive streaming field. NBC’s Peacock lost nearly $1 billion in a single quarter of 2022.

Yet it remains to be seen if Disney’s downsizing is the solution to the problem. Though layoffs often appease investors in the short-term, the strategy might not pan out so well for the company in the long-term.

4/21/2023,Not Even Jeopardy Contestants Know What the Metaverse Is,"Trivia champions foiled by a tech buzzword.

Mark Zuckerberg isn’t the only person who’s lost a lot of money on the metaverse. On Thursday, three additional public figures made the mistake of betting their cash on the concept. All of the contestants on the April 20, 2023 episode of Jeopardy failed to correctly answer the final prompt of the game, and all of them had wagered thousands on it.

In the category “Modern Words,” host Ken Jennings read the Final Jeopardy clue aloud: “Neal Stephenson coined this word in his 1992 novel ‘Snow Crash’; It was later shortened by a company to become its new name.”

The correct response: “What is metaverse?”

The responses the contestants gave:

“What is powder?”

“What is Uber?”

“What is avalanche?”

On “powder”, architectural designer Devin Lohman lost $8,300. With “Uber,” Emma Hill Kepron, a librarian, sank $4,000. “Avalanche” crashed history professor Sam Claussen’s earnings by $12,401. Small potatoes compared to Zuckerberg’s billions in losses, but still not nothing! Entering the round, Claussen was in the lead. But Hill Kepron clinched the winning spot simply by virtue of betting smaller than her competitors.

Modern Words | Final Jeopardy! | JEOPARDY!

It was a rare moment in a gameshow where usually, someone on the stage has the question to the answer. But maybe also it’s a good reminder that the metaverse is a verified money pit that nobody really understands.

What IS metaverse?

Well, in Zuckerberg’s 2021 words, “the defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence—like you are right there with another person or in another place...In the metaverse, you’ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine.” It also could be “the next evolution of social connection,” depending on the day.

According to Stephenson’s Snow Crash, it’s the dystopian evolution of the Internet wherein people live large segments of their lives plugged into a virtual reality that gets hijacked by a virus.

But in the actual world—Earth 2023—Meta’s metaverse efforts have basically just amounted to an oddly rendered Second Life dupe. Bonus: Meta wants you to buy some really expensive headwear to get the full experience.

Zuckerberg rebranded his whole entire company as Meta to prioritize the in-development technology. But now, less than two years after Facebook’s name change, Meta is pulling back from its virtual reality ambitions. In lieu, the social media giant is pivoting (once again) to what it hopes will be greener pastures in artificial intelligence.

Elsewhere, the metaverse ventures of other companies and intergovernmental organizations that hopped on the hype train have fizzled out too. Disney scrapped its entire metaverse sector last month. The “military metaverse” is no more. The European Union could hardly get anyone to show up to its pricy metaverse party. Even the brands couldn’t rally much consumer enthusiasm.

So, what is “metaverse”? Well, it’s a sci-fi creation, a tech buzzword, a “place” on the Internet, a bad investment, a sort of video game where you float around looking like a Mii, and a missed Jeopardy response. It may be a modern word, but on the timescale of tech hype, it’s ancient terminology. No offense to Jeopardy, but in this case, the better question about the metaverse is probably: “Who cares?”.",https://gizmodo.com/final-jeopardy-contestants-fail-metaverse-answer-1850361817
4/21/2023,"Twitter Demands Advertisers Pay for a Blue Check or Spend $1,000 a Month","Photo: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com (Shutterstock)

One day after Elon Musk followed through on his months-long threat to remove blue checks from Twitter accounts that were verified before his tenure, Twitter sent advertisers an email telling them they can’t advertise on the platform unless they subscribe to Twitter Blue. Accounts that already spend $1,000 or more a month will apparently be exempt.


“Starting April 21, your @account must have a verified check mark or subscribe to either Twitter Blue or Verified Organizations,” Twitter’s email read, according to several Twitter users who posted screenshots of the message. “Business accounts spending in excess of $1,000 per month already have gold checks or will soon, and they’ll continue to enjoy access to advertising without interruption at this time.”

ADVERTISEMENT

It’s a bizarre strategy, considering the fact that Twitter is the one in the equation that lacks access to advertising. The beginning of Musk’s ownership of Twitter started a mass exodus of advertisers who didn’t want their ads to run on a social network that might soon be inundated with hate speech and other disturbing content, which Twitter was. Reports suggest Twitter’s advertising income, the company’s main source of revenue by a mile, is still in dire straits.

“This change aligns with Twitter’s broader verification strategy: to elevate the quality of content on Twitter and enhance your experience as a user and advertiser. This approach also supports our ongoing efforts to reduce fraudulent accounts and bots,” Twitter’s email said. “Subscribing to either of these services means you have been verified by Twitter as a real person and/or business.”

It’s unclear how forcing advertisers to pay more does a better job than the previous verification system. Throwing up an additional barrier to the pool of potential advertisers still willing to spend on Twitter is all but guaranteed to drive marketers away, and a number of advertising professionals on Twitter said as much.

ADVERTISEMENT

The ploy seems likely to cost the company more than it could ever recoup from advertisers willing to spend an extra $8 for the privilege of giving Twitter money. A number of players in the advertising business wrote on Twitter that the move will likely hurt the company’s marketing business.

Musk’s self-sabotage-first-ask-questions-later strategy has infected nearly every part of Twitter’s operation. Twitter’s new verification process does little to confirm an account’s identity aside from confirm that the user has a working phone number.

ADVERTISEMENT

When Musk first opened blue checks up to anyone willing to cough up $8, trolls seized the opportunity and started impersonating major brands and prominent figures. One tweet coming from a user pretending to be Eli Lily tanked the drug manufactuerer’s stock, erasing billions of dollars in market cap. Yesterday, when Twitter removed legacy verification from any account that wasn’t coughing up Musk’s $8 protection money, the trolls stuck again, impersonating prominent accounts that lost their check marks.

ADVERTISEMENT

Twitter auto-responds with a poop emoji when you email its communications department, reflecting the billionaire’s utter disdain for members of the press unwilling to lick his billionaire boots. In related news, Twitter did not immediately reply to Gizmodo’s request for comment. However, Twitter’s email to advertisers explained the “strategy” behind its decision to coerce advertisers to pay for Twitter Blue.

Musk’s impulsive business strategies often lead to immediate backlash. Typically his response is to get defensive, though sometimes he reverses course. Over the past month, Twitter applied a “state sponsored media” label to the NPR account, demonstrating his own ignorance about the business model of public broadcasting. NPR and several other outlets then announced they would stop using Twitter. On Thursday, Twitter removed all state affiliated and state sponsored labels from the platform, including accounts from actual propaganda outlets, such as the Kremlin’s RT.


ADVERTISEMENT

The CEO’s reactionary public relations tactics crop up in Twitter’s ongoing advertising train wrecks as well. Musk famously called for a “thermonuclear name and shame” against advertisers that fled Twitter in his early days at the company. Somehow, that didn’t seem to win back any advertisers who left because they were worried about reputational risks.

This week saw another example: Microsoft announced it dropped Twitter from its advertising network, which will have serious financial consequences for the social media network. Musk responded with a threat, tweeting a comment on an article about the move that referenced the data used to train AI algorithms in Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. “They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time,” Musk tweeted.",https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-twitter-blue-advertisers-required-1850361922
4/21/2023,Parler Could Get a Spin-Off by Disgruntled Former Employees,"Image: Ascannio (Shutterstock)

Disgruntled former Parler employees are pushing back against Starboard’s acquisition of the platform, saying they will create their own version of the far-right social media site that fulfills its original goals. Known for its role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the platform is reportedly heading in a direction that has frustrated its former staff.

According to The Daily Beast, a Discord server called “Parler Life Raft” was recently organized for Parler allies and the site’s former employees to brainstorm ideas for launching a spinoff site.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Parler management are straight up f*ggots,” Dennis Harrison, whose LinkedIn lists him as lead engineer at the company, wrote in a private Discord server viewed by The Daily Beast. “They ruined something good.” In a separate message, Harrison complained, “They finally revoked my VPN access so I can no longer run bootleg Parler from the Parler laptop they gave me. I’ll take forever to send back.”

Starboard completed its acquisition of Parler last week, calling it an “uncancelable free speech platform” in a news release, and saying it will provide a home for people “away from the ad-hoc regulatory hand of platforms that hate them.” The company removed the app with plans to relaunch it, citing it as a “strategic assessment” and called it a “Twitter clone” for conservatives that isn’t a “viable business anymore.”

Starboard did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.

Former employees appear to believe there’s still a market for a platform with the far-right ideals which contributed to Amazon and Google’s decision to drop Parler in 2021. Harrison wrote to his fellow cohorts in another post that they could “probably commit to sending out [a] link next week,” to the spin-off site, provided they are clear that it is only a beta test. He wrote that the site will be “probably 65% Parler. Totally wild west for the next month,” The Daily Beast reported.

ADVERTISEMENT

Parler loyalists clapped back at Starboard’s takeover, including the co-founder and former CEO, John Matze, who openly criticized the direction Parler has taken in recent years. “Many of the original founders and employees can’t even say the name anymore,” Matze wrote on Discord. “But I understand wanting to hold onto the good memories of what we all had. I miss the community.” He added, “Maybe burn it. Let’s find something new. I trashed everything Parler from my house a long time ago.”

Parler markets itself as a “free speech” platform and does not adhere to the typical practices of monitoring hate speech, inciteful posts, or moderate right-wing extremists on its site. But as Twitter lifts its moderation policies and more people flock back to the platform, Harrison reportedly told his fellow Discord channel members that he expects they will soon receive roughly $300 a month in donations and after taking it public, estimated it “will go up to $500.”

Harrison told The Daily Beast, the group doesn’t have plans to explicitly clone Parler. Instead, he insists, they’re “doing something better.”",https://gizmodo.com/disgruntled-employees-want-to-recreate-original-parler-1850362018
4/21/2023,TikTok's CEO Breaks Silence After Brutal Congressional Hearing,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana (AP)

On Thursday, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew give his first interview since sparring with House lawmakers in a testy hearing back in March. Chew is one of dozens of business leaders speaking at the TED2023 “Possibility” conference held in Vancouver, Canada. In a softball discussion that saw that the interviewer praising Chew and asking for a selfie, the embattled CEO reiterated the ways TikTok is addressing public criticisms, and explained why his app is good for America and the world.

“What we have done is that based on our machine learning algorithms on showing people what they like. And what they means is we’re giving the everyday person a platform to be discovered,” Chew said, contrasting TikTok with other apps such as Facebook and Instagram that are built on social networks. “I think it’s very freeing to have a platform where, as long as you have talent, you’re going to be heard and you have a chance to succeed.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Thanks to easy questions with little to no follow up, the interview was largely a foil to Chew’s congressional hearing. Both events were pointless but for opposite reasons. In the House of Representatives, congress traded meaningful questions for political grandstanding. On the TED stage, it looked more like a casual chat between new friends.

TikTok CEO Shou Chew on Its Future — and What Makes Its Algorithm Different | Live at TED2023

“You’re super compelling and likable as a CEO,” said Chris Anderson, curator of TED, before asking Chew to take a selfie and post it on TikTok.

Chew, who has been on a weeks-long campaign to try and persuade lawmakers not to ban the app in the US, spoke about entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence, and society’s connection to social media. Elon Musk took part in a similar TED interview around this time last year where he expounded on his rationale for buying Twitter and tried to articulate his often incorrect definition of freedom of speech.

TikTok’s CEO’s first public interview since combative House hearing

Chew’s brief interview marks his first major public appearance since a five-hour-long, mostly-bad-faith grilling from lawmakers sitting on the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March. When Chew could (occasionally) get a word in, he tried to paint a picture of TikTok as a safe, “sunny corner of the internet” used by some 150 million Americans, close to half of the country, according to the company.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle were unconvinced. Instead, many railed against TikTok for allegedly catalyzing harmful misinformation and dangerous health trends while another more raucous cohort demanded Chew prove TikTok couldn’t be used by the Chinese government as a surveillance tool. Exasperated, Chew told one lawmaker he felt like he was being faced with the impossible task of proving a negative.

The TikTok CEO ostensibly went to DC to attach a human face to the app and try to temper growing calls for a nationwide ban, but it seems like the hearing may have had the opposite effect. Chew was forced to admit publicly that ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, does currently have access to US user data on an “as-required basis” Though Chew assured lawmakers that would no longer be the case once TikTok completes its Project Texas data routing partnership with Oracle, the connections with mainland China gave hawkish lawmakers even more ammunition to attack the company.

ADVERTISEMENT

Project Texas is essentially a plan to house American user data on servers in the United States, as though there isn’t an internet where you can share data over an email. It’s an intersting prospect, to say the least, but on the TED stage, Chew had nothing new to share.

“What we did was we built an unprecedented project where we localize American data, to be stored on American soil, by an American company, overseen by American personnel,” Chew said. So this this kind of protection for American data is beyond what any other company in our industry has ever done.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Another key concern from American lawmakers is the possibility that TikTok to promote or censor certain content to advance China’s political goals. These propaganda concerns are serious, where most experts with a real understanding of the internet argue the data privacy and security issues are overblown.

“The way we are trying to address this concern is an unprecedented amount of transparency. What do I mean by this? We’re actually allowing third party reviewers to come in and review the source code. I don’t know any other company that does this,” Chew said.

Ready or not, TikTok bans are around the corner

It might have seemed unlikely just a few months ago, but calls to ban TikTok are gaining meaningful momentum. The federal government and more than half of all US states have already passed legislation banning the app on government devices. There are currently around half a dozen other bills floating through Congress that, one way or another, would result in a full-on national TikTok ban if they’re passed.

ADVERTISEMENT

Pressure is mounting on the state level too. Last week, Montana officials became the first state to pass legislation banning the app on private devices, leading to fear a snowball effect of copycat laws from other states could ensue. Dozens of civil liberties groups including the ACLU oppose the bans on First Amendment grounds and say they would deal a crushing blow to freedom of expression online if they’re allowed to pass.

A handful of Democrats in Congress have spoken out forcefully against further restricting the app, but they are in the minority. Nearly every Republican on record, minus libertarian Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, meanwhile seems supportive of a national ban. Even Joe Biden’s administration, which long remained silent on the issues, has since said it wants to see a forced spinoff of TikTok’s US business.

ADVERTISEMENT

The general public, on the other hand, seems more split on how to handle TikTok. A recent Washington Post poll found 41% of US adults said they support a federal ban on the app. A slightly higher portion (49%) of adults in a recent SocialSphere poll similarly said they support a ban.

Somehow, the looming threat of bans didn’t come up at Thursday’s interview, leaving conversations about one of the most significant developments in tech for another day.

4/20/2023,My Pillow Guy Has to Pay $5 Million to Cyber Guy Who Proved Him Wrong,"Mike Lindell remains a major figure in right wing politics, even making an appearance at the 2023 CPAC despite a federal investigation and multiple defamation lawsuits.

Mike Lindell, the My Pillow Guy and prominent 2020 election denier, needs to lay out a lot more cushions on his legs to stop him from shooting himself in the foot. His mealy-mouthed rhetoric surrounding the “Big Lie” caused him to make easily-disproved proclamations and more than a few promises he could not keep. Two years ago, Lindell promised anybody a $5 million prize if they could prove that Chinese hackers did not mess with U.S. voting machines to elect President Joe Biden. On Wednesday, one cyber forensics expert finally came to collect.

The payout traces back to a “cyber symposium” Lindell hosted back in 2021. He invited all his favorite friends and frenemies, including former Trump administration officials, cybersecurity professionals, and news media to once again hash out the “Big Lie” live. At the symposium, Lindell said his “evidence” consisted of network traffic data that he promised would show the Dominion voting machines had been rigged by Chinese hackers in favor of President Joe Biden. He also announced a $5 million reward for anyone willing to “Prove Mike Wrong” about his data.

ADVERTISEMENT

The whole event fell apart once Josh Merritt, the “cyber expert” hired to share the information, told Lindell he and his team couldn’t verify any of what the election denier was saying.


At the time, Merritt said that the $5 million bounty to “Prove Mike Wrong” was “no longer on the table,” though at least one cyber professional felt differently. Robert Zeidman, who The Washington Post described as a Trump voter and computer forensics expert, said he examined Lindell’s data and found it was not related to the 2020 election. He submitted his claim on the $5 million bounty to the American Arbitration Association, who on Wednesday agreed Zeidman was indeed owed the multi-million dollar payout because, well, he proved Mike wrong.

On Twitter, Zeidman, the president of a software analysis company, posted a cryptic message Wednesday simply saying “I won!” He further told the Post that “the data we were given at the symposium was not at all what Mr. Lindell said it was.” Lindell, on the other hand, told the outlet “This will be going to court.”

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the arbitration document provided to the Post, the payout has to come from Lindell LLC. The 23-page document describes the back and forth between Friedman and Lindell’s lawyers arguing the finer points of the data analysis. According to the document, Zeidman was provided several pdfs and text files—including ones that were simply “gibberish”— and a .mp4 video file with no sound showing a screen capture of extracted computer code. Lindell’s attorneys argued that the code in the video was related to the election.

But Lindell’s attorneys couldn’t actually show what resulted from the data extraction or prove that the data shown in the video had anything to do with election data. The other files offered to contestants included random hexadecimal data that contained “IP addresses and numbers ranking the addresses from high to low.” Lindell’s lawyers said the IP addresses were linked to China. Zeidman was also provided several large .bin files that he couldn’t open with regular tools like Wireshark, adding that he could find no way to extract the data. Generally, it seems like Lindell would’ve been fooled by a Matrix text screensaver if you said it was proof that the election was stolen.

ADVERTISEMENT

All in all, the My Pillow Guy shouldn’t be too stressed about a measly $5 million. Lindell is under federal investigation and remains in the middle of a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. Just this week, the voting machine company finalized a $787.5 million settlement with Fox News, so now it may have more time to focus on Lindell as well as the multiple individuals and “news” networks who lied about the 2020 election.",https://gizmodo.com/mike-lindell-must-pay-5-million-cyber-expert-stolen-1850358244
4/20/2023,Why Did Fox News Agree to the Massive Dominion Settlement?,"Fox News has sought a settlement with Dominion for a while now, but the remaining question is how much its recent court setbacks influenced its decision-making.

Fox News’s $787.5 million settlement agreement with Dominion Voting Systems is a hefty chunk of change. It’s one of the largest defamation payout ever for a defamation suit representing more than half of its total profit from last year, though the right-wing media company will likely sustain the blow. But the payout itself has led to a massive wave of speculation and conjecture. Was Fox going along with its previous settlement goal, or was it more concerned about what would come out in court?

We now have a strangled pinhole of light on Fox’s decision-making process. Based on several anonymous sources connected to Fox, Bloomberg reports that the News Corp-owned media company was pushed into settlement talks because of the unexpected lawsuit from former Tucker Carlson producer Abby Grossberg. She filed a sex and religious discrimination lawsuit in March and has recently contended Fox did not hand over all the necessary information for the Dominion case during the discovery process.

ADVERTISEMENT

Grossberg has claimed in her lawsuit that Fox had “coerced, intimidated, and misinformed” her to provide false testimony last year regarding what she knew about Fox’s proliferation of the bungled 2020 election fraud allegations. During a pre-trial hearing, Dominion shared several recordings made by Grossberg documenting calls between host Maria Bartiromo and Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s lawyer at the time, as well as other figures for Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis then ordered a probe into whether Fox had withheld evidence during discovery. Fox lawyers claimed they didn’t know about the tapes until recently. Even with the settlement, that probe is ongoing.

Parisis Filipatos, Grossberg’s lawyer, told MSNBC last week that his team turned over the recordings to Fox months ago, but later realized those tapes were not found anywhere in the Dominion lawsuit records. Bloomberg cited its sources saying the network was concerned the tape would be used to hurt its hosts and Fox Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch when they would be likely asked to stand as witnesses. Murdoch is the executive chairman of News Corp., Fox’s parent company.

A Fox News spokesperson told Gizmodo in an email statement “Bloomberg’s report is wildly inaccurate and completely false.”

The Wall Street Journal, which is also owned by News Corp., shared a timeline of how the settlement started and finished, painting the image that both sides had a good reason to settle. The settlement was devised over four days by mediator Jerry Roscoe, who was on a European river cruise at the time.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Journal reported that Fox had been seeking a settlement for quite some time. According to an interview with an exec with the private equity firm that owns Dominion, the election tech company wanted the network to sweat until they managed to expose some of the election lies given wings by Fox hosts and execs. Emails and texts from inside Fox showed hosts privately shared their concerns and antipathy toward the election deniers. Murdoch himself was also dragged for how he supported Republicans in both Congress and the White House despite the hurricane of “Stop the Steal” lies after the 2020 election.

The Grossberg tapes themselves are tangentially relevant to the Dominion case, but it remains unclear how much play they would have seen in court. MSNBC aired a part of the off-air recordings between Bartiromo and Guiliani, where the “Big Lie” figurehead said he “can’t prove” that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a financial “interest” in Dominion. This was a major aspect of the “stop the steal” pusher’s allegations less than three years ago. Guiliani’s speculation into Pelosi and Dominion’s relationshipp was not previously one of the main statements made on the air that Dominion contended was defamatory.

ADVERTISEMENT

If Fox was concerned about the way its leaders would look, that hasn’t come through in its after-action announcements. Fox devoted all of six minutes to the settlement announcement on Tuesday during four hours of broadcasts. After they announced the payout, the election technology company’s lawyers declared it a victory representing “vindication and accountability.” Fox, on the other hand, said it “reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.” The Intercept reported Wednesday that Fox’s stock only took a brief hit after the settlement, but was quickly back to trading where it had been on Election Day 2020.

Still, Fox has more defamation lawsuits coming around the bend that could punch a hole in its thinning credibility. Smartmatic, another electronic voting machine company, is working on its own multi-billion defamation lawsuit against Fox. The company is also facing some blowback from shareholders. These lawsuits will be emboldened by Dominion’s outcome, so even more settlements could be in Fox’s future.",https://gizmodo.com/fox-news-settlement-secret-recording-grossberg-dominion-1850357140

BuzzFeed News is closing.

CEO Jonah Peretti announced Buzzfeed is closing in a company-wide memo to staff on Thursday: “We are reducing our workforce by approximately 15% today across our Business, Content, Tech, and Admin teams, and beginning the process of closing BuzzFeed News.” The cuts will affect roughly 180 employees.

“I could have managed these changes better as the CEO of this company and our leadership team could have performed better despite these circumstances,” Peretti wrote. “I made the decision to overinvest in BuzzFeed News because I love their work and mission so much.”

BuzzFeed News’ final push notification read, “BuzzFeed News is logging off with a reminder that blippi pooped on his friend,” referencing its investigation into a famous YouTuber, Blippi, who makes videos for young children but who once pooped on a man in a “Harlem Shake” video.

Peretti said his company will be focusing its news efforts on HuffPost, recently acquired, which has proved to be more lucrative than BuzzFeed News, according to Peretti’s email: “Moving forward, we will have a single news brand in HuffPost, which is profitable, with a loyal direct front page audience.”

“While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division, we’ve determined that the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization,” Peretti wrote.

He also told staff that the Covid-19 pandemic, the tech industry’s recession, the declining stock market, and reduced digital advertising all contributed to the decision.

Although BuzzFeed News is closing, the company will continue to operate media operations on its other platforms, and Peretti said cost-cutting measures will take effect including closing several of its New York City and Los Angeles offices, reducing its budget, travel, and “most other discretionary, non-revenue generating expenditures.”

According to the memo, some BuzzFeed editors and reporters will be redistributed to other areas of the company in accordance with their skill set, while the company’s CRO Edgar Hernandez and COO Christian Baesler will also be leaving BuzzFeed within the coming weeks.

The news outlet Insider announced to staff via email Thursday morning that the company lay off 10% of its workforce, including staff writers.


Insider Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Carlson announced last week that the outlet’s writers would be experimenting with ChatGPT. Asked if the layoffs were related to the nascent use of the AI chatbot, an Insider spokesperson said, “Of course not.”

Insider Incorporated president Barbara Peng announced that layoffs in an email to staff this morning that was obtained by Gizmodo and first reported by The Daily Beast. Peng wrote that staff members affected by the layoffs would be receiving a notification 15 minutes after her email to the company was sent. Affected staff will receive 13 weeks of base pay with two additional weeks for each year they worked up to four years, medical coverage through August 2023, and career support services including resume reviews and one-one-ones with coaches.

“As you know, our industry has been under significant pressure for more than a year. The economic headwinds that have hurt many of our clients and partners are also affecting us,” said Peng. “Unfortunately to keep our company healthy and competitive, we need to reduce the size of our team. We have tried hard to avoid taking this step, and we are sorry about the impact it will have on many of you.”

Peng explained in her email that the layoffs would impact the unionized workforce at the outlet, meaning writers would be included in the cuts. Insider’s presidet claimed in her email that management was unable to communicate the layoffs to the union, citing unspecified “union rules.” An Insider employee in the union told Gizmodo that the union was not informed of the layoffs ahead of time and received no opportunity to bargain with management. The Insider Union did not immediately return Gizmodo’s request for comment.

An Insider spokesperson told Gizmodo that the union was notified at the same time as staff, though he did not specify what rules Peng was referring to in her email. He said that the company was negotiating with the union on a final number of represented staff members that would be affected by the cuts.

Carlson said in a letter to staff, posted to Insider itself last week, that the outlet was looking to set up a working group of staff writers to test how to responsibly add artificial intelligence into the company’s workflow with internal applications. He suggested using AI to develop outlines for stories, find typos to save editors time, create headlines that are optimized for search engines, and serve as an explainer of complex topics. He informed staff not to feed sensitive information concerning sources to ChatGPT and cautioned all of the outlet’s writers not to include text generated by ChatGPT or any other AI chatbots verbatim in their articles.

Amongst a growing tidal wave of tech layoffs, staff cuts have likewise affected media in 2023. ABC News, NPR, Buzzfeed, and Vox Media are just some of the notable outlets along with Insider that have laid off staff members in recent months.",https://gizmodo.com/business-insider-layoffs-ai-chatgpt-tests-1850356792
4/20/2023,"Imgur Bans NSFW Content, Begins Purge","Out with the old and out with the new too, I guess.
Image: Postmodern Studio (Shutterstock)

Imgur has announced a new policy on NSFW content—and you should say goodbye to all of it. The image, GIF, and video hosting platform familiar to Redditors everywhere has announced that beginning May 15 it will be forbidding all future (and purging all pre-existing) NSFW content posted by users.


Imgur released its refreshed Terms of Service yesterday, which breaks down the ban on explicit media. After serving as a third-party platform for erotic subreddits across the web, Imgur has now decided to take a less horny route forward. The company announced that explicit content can no longer be posted moving forward—this includes any explicit or implied sexual acts as well as full or partial nudity. The new policy also includes the removal of all content depicting pornography or nudity that was posted in the past.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We will be focused on removing old, unused, and inactive content that is not tied to a user account from our platform as well as nudity, pornography, & sexually explicit content,” Imgur said in its announcement. “You will need to download/save any images that you wish to save if they no longer adhere to these Terms. Most notably, this would include explicit/pornographic content.”

The decision is bound to send Redditors into a tailspin, as Imgur has served as a third-party platform for media uploads to Reddit for years. Until 2016, the then-11-year-old Reddit relied heavily on Imgur to host content like photos and videos  on the site. While Imgur is still heavily used on Reddit to this day, the social media platform introduced its own photo-uploading tool in 2016. Now, Imgur has primarily been relegated to use in subreddits publishing pornographic content (not that I would know) since NSFW media cannot be uploaded using Reddit’s in-house tool.

The platform said in its release that this change is “an important step in Imgur’s continued efforts to remain a safe and fun space on the internet,” and expressed its gratitude to its users with a GIF of a puppy to try and cut the tension. While maintaining user safety on the Internet through mechanisms like banning non-consensual porn is crucial and notable, Imgur seems to not understand what its own user base is doing on its platform. It’ll only be a matter of time until another image hosting service fills in the vacuum that Imgur is leaving behind as Reddit’s chief porn destination.

Imgur’s decision to ban unsavory content mimics a similar decision Tumblr made in 2018—the blogging platform also opted to remove pre-existing and future content that it deemed explicit. Tumblr’s decision to remove NSFW media was a bumpy ride, with its removal bot flagging images of dogs and kids instead of naked bodies while further stigmatizing the online sex work industry. Naturally, Tumblr’s move resulted in users flocking from the platform, with reporting by Mashable claiming that Tumblr saw a nearly 30% decline in its user base. Tumblr eventually kinda sorta walked back on the decision and, last fall, announced that the website would host nudity but no explicit sex.",https://gizmodo.com/imgur-bans-nsfw-content-will-delete-old-posts-1850356455
4/19/2023,Tech CEO Applauds an Employee Selling Off Their Pet Dog to Accommodate Return-to-Office Push,"James Clarke addresses staff at his most charismatic in a virtual meeting call.
Screenshot: Gizmodo

Meet the new hero of hustle culture: James Clarke, CEO of Clearlink, a Utah-based digital marketing company. This champion of capital had his grindset on lock in a video call with employees last week.


“I challenge any one of you to outwork me, but you won’t,” he told his staff in a virtual meeting meant to address a forced return-to-office for Clearlink workers living within 50 miles of the company headquarters, as first reported by Vice News. “I’m all in on what we’re doing here at Clearlink, and I want you to know it and feel it,” he added as part of his no-holds-barred screed to staff, which was recorded and posted to Reddit and YouTube a few days ago. The video was removed from the internet after Clearlink apparently filed a copyright complaint. However, Vice obtained and re-posted an edited version of the footage on Wednesday.

ADVERTISEMENT

First, some background: On April 3, Clarke notified employees via email that anyone living within 50 miles of his company’s Draper, Utah headquarters would need to start showing up at the Clearlink office four days a week beginning April 17. This came just a few months after the company assured staff that there were “no plans to require anyone to work in the new Draper office,” in an internal October email excerpt included in the Vice report.

But then, the company execs changed their minds. Of the return-to-office policy, the company wrote “leadership believes this is the best decision at this time to ensure the near and long-term success of the company,” in an additional internal document viewed and excerpted by Vice. Employees, many of whom were reportedly hired on the understanding that their jobs would be permanently remote, were predictably unenthused and confused by the change. Hence, the need for an all-hands address from the top exec.

The off-the-rails recording of the CEO was seemingly meant to assuage concerns about the remote vs. in-person work policy reversal. But the overall message isn’t so reassuring. In the video, Clarke levies some big accusations at his staff. Among them: that 30 remote employees had entirely stopped logging on in a “quiet quitting” coup. He expressed suspicions that some of Clearlink’s developers had been holding down positions at other companies without Clearlink’s knowledge. He told content writers they should be using AI to increase output “30-50 times our normal production.”

But hey, let’s not forget the positives. In a well-earned celebration of one employee’s efforts, Clarke implied that staff should go as far as getting rid of beloved animal companions to better serve Clearlink. “I’ve sacrificed, and those of you that are here have sacrificed greatly to be here as well—to be away from your family,” he said (presumably addressing the present and accounted for, in-person workers). “I learned from one of our leaders that, in the midst of hearing this message, [someone] went out and sold their family dog,” the CEO then said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Mixing the message a little bit, Clarke added that the dog anecdote “breaks my heart, as someone who’s been at the head of the humanization of pets movement in other businesses that we’ve built.” (For reference: Clarke spent 10 years on the board of the company PetIQ, which sells pet care products and veterinary services, according to the CEO’s LinkedIn page.) But still, such sacrifices are apparently a necessary and laudable part of excelling at Clearlink.

Unfortunately for Clarke’s company and the working mothers it employs, human children are not as easily dispatched with as family pets. In a section of the meeting concerning childcare challenges, Clearlink’s CEO openly questioned the ability of mothers—yes, specifically mothers—to both offer adequate value to the company and their kids.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Breadwinning mothers were hit the very hardest by this pandemic. Many of you have tried to tend your own children and in doing so also manage your demanding work schedules and responsibilities. And while I know you’re doing your best... one could argue this path is neither fair to your employer, nor fair to those children,” Clarke opined.

“I don’t necessarily believe that,” he immediately backtracked before flip-flopping again and doubling down. “But I do believe that only the rarest of full-time caregivers can also be a productive and full-time employee at the same time. You may take issue with any part of this, but I believe the data will also support this in time.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Note: Utah has laws in place that outlaw employer discrimination against workers related to pregnancy and childbirth status and conditions. However, the state doesn’t have any provision on the books protecting caregivers from workplace discrimination (unlike New York City).

Amid all of this, Clarke also managed to reference that he is “an alumn” of Harvard and Oxford, schools which, in his words, were “founded and operated under the Judeo-Christian ethic.” Then, he threw in his own feelings of persecution: Lambasting diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and accusing unnamed Clearlink staff of making fun of his religion and likening him to a “convicted Wall Street felon” (Gordon Gekko, per Vice).

ADVERTISEMENT

“I took it and I listened and I was kind and I responded with kindness, but no more,” Clarke reportedly said in a video segment viewed but not re- by Vice. “You have misinterpreted my kindness for weakness. You have continued to do so, and it will stop,” he added, rather ominously.

Gizmodo reached out to Clearlink to verify the recording and get more information on the company’s stances and policies. But Clearlink did not respond as of publication time. To Vice, the company said the recorded meeting was an internal matter, and reiterated that the return-to-office push would help Clearlink reach its “collective goals.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“We look forward to having these team members join us at our new world-class Global Headquarters in Draper, UT and appreciate the efforts of all of our committed team members–which includes those who work in office and those who will continue to work remotely–as we accomplish our best work together,” company spokesperson Layne Watson told the outlet.

Of course, Clearlink is in good company with its push to get back to in-office toil. Tech giants like Meta, Google, and Apple have all also rescinded their pandemic-era work-from-home policies—despite mounting evidence that remote employees may actually be more productive. But the CEO wants what the CEO wants. And if the CEO suggests getting rid of your dog to accommodate your work schedule, know that a true corporate devotee wouldn’t bat an eye.",https://gizmodo.com/clearlink-ceo-clarke-sell-your-dog-for-the-office-1850353910
4/18/2023,Fox News and Dominion Settle Defamation Dispute for $787.5 Million,"Dominion Voting Systems’ attorney, Justin Nelson, addresses the press outside Delaware’s New Castle County Courthouse.

Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News have reached a settlement in the companies’ two-year-long defamation dispute. The agreement was announced by the case’s presiding judge in court on Tuesday afternoon, according to multiple reports—coming just hours after jury selection was completed. The decision by both parties to settle moves what could’ve been a landmark case for media and misinformation out of the courtroom, and thus out of the public eye.


The settlement grants Dominion a $787.6 million payout, less than half of the $1.6 billion in damages the company had initially demanded, according to the New York Times.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” Fox News said in a statement to the Times and Reuters. Dominion’s CEO, John Poulos, reportedly called the settlement “historic.”

Dominion, which supplied voting machines and software to dozens of states during the 2020 U.S. election, first sued Fox News in 2021. In that 443-page complaint, the voting tech company alleged that the media outlet knowingly broadcast multiple debunked conspiracy theories and other disinformation about its machines, which amounted to defamation and libel.

And for a time, it seemed like the case might go to trial—potentially compelling Fox News bigwigs like Rupert Murdoch to testify about their network’s conduct. Just a few weeks ago, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled that resolving the case would require a jury because Dominion hadn’t clearly proved libelous intent. Simultaneously Judge Davis squashed Fox’s attempts to weasel out of the suit entirely. In a pre-trial hearing earlier this month, Davis said Fox wouldn’t be able to defend itself under the umbrella of “newsworthiness.”

But just yesterday, the trial was delayed for settlement talks. And now, we’re here. There will be no trial. There will be no public testimony. Dominion’s complaint has been sated with dollar bills. Though, Fox News hasn’t yet escaped all legal scrutiny for its 2020 election coverage and promotion of “stop the steal” conspiracies. Smartmatic, another voting machine maker, still has an outstanding lawsuit against Fox. That pending case could be even bigger, as Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion in damages.

4/18/2023,Back to the Mines: Iowa Senate Moves to Legalize Child Labor in Pre-Dawn Session,"“Break time’s over,” Iowa Republican’s say.

As companies like Uber transition the world onto the gig economy, and AI promises to eliminate the need for large swaths of the workforce, the great state of Iowa is taking a stand, declaring once and for all that child labor is good, actually.

In a session starting at 3:36 am Tuesday morning, Republicans in the Iowa Senate passed SF 542, a bill that undoes protections for child workers, according to WHO 13 News Des Moines, a local NBC affiliate. It’s part of a broader Republican-led effort to undo protections for children in the United States.

ADVERTISEMENT

The bill lets 14-year-olds work six-hour night shifts, clears 15-year-olds for work in factories and assembly lines, and carves out exceptions to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to serve alcohol.

SF 542 passed 32 to 17, with every Democrat and two Republicans voting against it. The bill now moves to the Iowa House of Representatives. Some call it child labor. Others, such as Iowa Republican Sen. Adrian Dickey, call it freedom.

“With this bill, we are strengthening and providing protections to our youth. We are not forcing them into slave labor. We are not selling our children. We are not even requiring them to work,” Sen. Dickey said on the Senate floor. See? No slavery. What more do you people want?

Federal child labor laws date back to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. But what the libs in Washington fail to understand is that children’s tiny fingers are perfect for reaching the bobbins in my textile factory. Fortunately, state lawmakers across the country are working hard to save American kids from the oppressive restrictions preventing them from taking their proper place in the sweatshops.

ADVERTISEMENT

If Iowa kids are lucky, they’ll get good, hardworking American jobs like the Department of Labor turned up in February. This year, the DOL found over 100 kids as young as 13 years old were working illegal jobs in slaughterhouses owned by Tyson, JBS, Cargill, and other companies. The children sometimes worked night shifts cleaning dangerous blades on kill floors, and at least three suffered injuries including chemical burns. Or maybe Sen. Dickey hopes his kids can get a gig with Hyundai-Kia, which is under investigation for employing 14-year-olds in factories across Alabama.

Ten states launched efforts to weaken child labor protections in the last year, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute. Several states have already passed laws weakening or lowering restrictions. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed a law this March eliminating age verification and parental consent requirements for kid workers. Iowa passed a separate pro-child labor law in 2022 and is considering another bill that would allow parents to lie about their kids’ ages to get them jobs.

ADVERTISEMENT

Those are just examples of laws that were enacted; the real fun is in the bills that haven’t been signed yet. Take Nebraska, where state lawmakers passed a bill that gives kids the right to work for less than minimum wage. And don’t forget little old Ohio! There, Republicans passed a bill that proposes kids should be “allowed” to work until 9 pm on school nights.

“The trend reflects a coordinated multi-industry push to expand employer access to low-wage labor and weaken state child labor laws in ways that contradict federal protections,” the Economic Policy Institute said in its report. “Children of families in poverty, and especially Black, brown, and immigrant youth, stand to suffer the most harm from such changes.”

ADVERTISEMENT

These aren’t hypothetical concerns. According to the US Department of Labor, the number of minors employed in violation of child labor laws was up 37% in the fiscal year 2022. And when you compare 2022's numbers to 2015, the child labor violations went up 283%.

Who could possibly be in favor of something like this? Why, industry trade groups and billionaires, of course. As the Economic Policy Institute put it:


Across the country, the primary proponents of these laws are business groups and their state affiliates, particularly the National Federation of Independent Business, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Restaurant Association (Lazare 2022). Hotel, lodging, and tourism associations, grocery industry associations, home builders, and Americans for Prosperity—a billionaire-funded right-wing dark money group—have also supported bills in various states

ADVERTISEMENT

Republicans across the country are hard at work finding more hard work for kids. Meanwhile, they’re working double-time eliminating other freedoms under the guise of saving those very same children. Sen. Dickey’s daughter caused a stir in 2022 when she cut off her dad for his work to create special rules that only transgender people have to follow and strip women of their right to reproductive healthcare. She went on to accuse her father of abuse, and posted, “There’s so much more money and power-driven things he’s done.”

Sen. Dickey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://gizmodo.com/iowa-senate-approves-bill-legalize-factory-child-labor-1850348003
4/18/2023,Elon Musk Tells Tucker Carlson He’s Creating a ChatGPT Rival Called TruthGPT,"Photo: Tada Images (Shutterstock)

Twitter CEO Elon Musk told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he was working on a rival to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a company he co-founded in 2015, called “TruthGPT.” According to Musk, his chatbot will be a “maximum truth-seeking AI” that will try to understand the nature of the universe.

In the first part of his interview with Carlson on Tucker Carlson Tonight, which Fox aired on Monday night, the Twitter CEO lambasted OpenAI for “training the AI to lie.” As interpreted by Musk, anecdotal evidence indicates that the model was trained to be “politically correct” or “woke.” Musk also criticized OpenAI for becoming for-profit, closed-source, and allying themselves with Microsoft.

ADVERTISEMENT

The main players in the field are now Google and OpenAI, the Twitter CEO explained, and the world needs a third option. Musk stepped down from OpenAI’s board in 2018.

“I’m going to start something which I’m going to call ‘TruthGPT,’ a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe,” Musk said. “I think this might be the best path to safety in the sense that an AI that cares about understanding the universe is unlikely to annihilate humans because we are an interesting part of the universe.”

The tech billionaire acknowledged that his TruthGPT, should it ever materialize, would be a late addition to the AI rat race. As with everything Musk says, the TruthGPT project should be taken with a grain of salt, given his propensity for promising all sorts of things and then delivering them very late (see: Semi Truck) or not at all (see: Cybertruck).

Nonetheless, there are indications that Musk has already started to make a move on his AI ambitions. In early March, Musk incorporated a company called “X.AI” and recent reports state that he’s been reaching out to AI researchers to sign them on to his new venture.

ADVERTISEMENT

Musk spent a good portion of his interview with Carlson talking about AI and stated that there should be a government agency in charge of regulating AI. The Twitter CEO also warned that AI could perhaps be more dangerous than mismanaged aircraft design or bad car production because “it has the potential of civilizational destruction.”

Last month, Musk was one of more than 500 experts who signed an open letter calling for a moratorium on AI system development for at least six months.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources,” the letter stated. “Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one—not even their creators—can understand, predict, or reliably control.”

The second part of Musk’s interview with Carlson will air tonight.

4/18/2023,Elon Musk's Twitter Tweaks Nuked These 13 Useful Emergency Service Bots,"Screenshot: U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center

Automated emergency and essential service Twitter accounts have become the latest casualty in Elon Musk’s flailing effort to rid Twitter of bots and squeeze users to pay for previously free access to its application programming interface (API).

Over half a dozen Twitter accounts associated with the National Weather Service tweeted out statements over the weekend saying Twitter had barred them from using its API. Twitter’s sudden suspension means the accounts are prevented from instantly pushing out automated weather alerts and warnings from their parent agencies. Those accounts have hundreds of thousands of followers collectively and are an invaluable safety tool for community members trying to keep track of potentially dangerous weather events. Twitter also suspended the US National Tsunami Warning Center’s API access before eventually reversing that decision. It remains unclear why Twitter decided to reverse course on some of those suspensions and not others.

Weather service accounts weren’t the only accounts impacted. Automated accounts associated with New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority and San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit also lost their API access, leaving millions of followers unable to receive up-to-date information on public transit delays or dangers via Twitter. Twitter has since reversed BART’s API suspension, but it’s unclear if it will do the same thing for the MTA.

All of that chaos and confusion stems from Musk’s haphazard attempt to monetize access to Twitter’s API. Starting this month, developers interested in accessing the API now have to choose between a Free, Basic, or Enterprise tiers. The free version provides ​​1,500 tweets each month at the app level. That figure jumps up to 3,000 tweets per month if developers fork over $100 for the Basic tear. The Enterprise tier, which is what most government agencies say they would need, costs an eye-watering $42,000 per month. Twitter argued the drastic changes to the once-free system were meant to combat Twitter’s bot plague. That may have worked, but Musk’s tier system is killing off good bots along with the bad.",https://gizmodo.com/twitter-elon-musk-mta-nws-bart-noaa-bots-api-shut-down-1850345806
4/17/2023,"Chinese Surveillance Giant Knew Its Cameras Spied on Uyghurs, War Crimes Investigator Says","In this photo taken Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018, visitors are tracked by facial recognition technology from state-owned surveillance equipment manufacturer Hikvision at the Security China 2018 expo in Beijing, China.
Photo: Ng Han Guan (AP)

Hikvision, a Chinese surveillance camera company restricted in parts of the US and the UK, knew its tech was used to monitor the country’s Uyghur Muslim minority despite previously denials of exactly that, according to a war crimes investigator hired by Hikvision itself. New leaked recordings give more credibility to allegations lobbed against Hikvision, which could threaten its ability to maintain its leading spot in the global CCTV & video surveillance equipment market.

Hikvision publicly denies its involvement in Uyghur detention, but new details from internal contracts and recordings revealed by Axios appear to show it was aware that its devices were used to target Uyghurs as a group as early as 2020. The recordings, first obtained by IPVM, show Richard-Pierre Prosper—a lawyer and war crimes investigator Hikvision hired to conduct an internal review of the company’s contacts in the Xinjiang region, where more than a million Uyghurs have been detained— expressing serious ethical concerns. One of the contracts, referred to as “The Moyu Project,” reportedly identified Uygurs as a target and called for surveillance and monitoring of their religious facilities. The company previously advertised its ability to identify and track specific ethnic minorities with its cameras. Hikvision says it has phased out that capability, but Prosper’s audit claims the Moyu contract included language involving “looking at groups and not isolated to a criminal.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“We’re not going to absolve the company,” Prosper, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues during the Bush administration, said during the recordings. “We don’t think you [Hikvision] were responsible, but there were some failings in the system where there’s some flags you should have looked at.”

Hikvision said in a statement it takes human rights issues seriously and is “fully aware of the room for further improvement, as evidenced by our efforts to enhance human rights compliance since 2018.”

Prosper’s audit reportedly involved some 15,000 pages of documents related to the company’s bid for around 15 contracts in the Xinjiang region. The investigator’s primary duty was to determine the company’s “responsibility and exposure” to human rights abuses in the area. Prosper was left troubled after looking into the Moyu project.

“This is a problem,” he wrote.

Hikvision faces pushback around the world

Hikvision has been in a years-long skirmish with regulators around the globe for its alleged close connection with the Chinese government. Human rights organizations and regulators claim Hikvision cameras were deployed in Chinese detention centers and ultimately used as photo evidence in the illegal detainment of Uyghurs. The country’s oppressed Muslim minority has faced brutal political persecution in China for years made possible by the government’s advanced surveillance capabilities.

ADVERTISEMENT

Regulators outside of China have used Hikvision’s connections to the Uyghur political persecutions to justify trade restrictions placed on some of its products. Hikvision may be less widely known than other controversial Chinese tech companies like Huawei or TikTok, but its footprint is arguably just as big. Analysts estimate Hikvision accounts for nearly 20% of all global CCTV cameras, leading MIT Technology Review to describe the firms as “the world’s biggest surveillance company you’ve never heard of.”

Late last year, the Federal Communications Commission said it would no longer authorize purchases of equipment made by Hikvision and a handful of other Chinese firms over potential “national security” threats. That move drastically limits the company’s ability to legally sell its products in the US. Hikvision hit back at the FCC in February with a lawsuit accusing the agency of exceeding its authority. The UK also recently banned Hikvision devices from “sensitive” areas over fears the company could share data with the Chinese government. The company claims it’s “categorically false to represent Hikvision as a threat to national security.”",https://gizmodo.com/hikvision-uyghurs-china-cctv-cameras-spying-detained-1850344113
4/17/2023,The National Guard Plans to Geofence High Schools and Target Kids' Phones With Recruitment Ads,"The header image of the Army National Guard’s “FAQs For Parents” page. The list of questions includes: “how do I know that my child is mature enough to enlist?” The answer: “No matter what stage of emotional development your child is in when they enter the Guard, they will soon be stronger, more confident and more capable.”

Teens love their screens, and the Department of Defense is prepared to take advantage of that. The Georgia Army National Guard has big plans to boost its recruitment efforts through targeted ads on high schoolers’ cell phones, according to a federal contract document obtained and first reported on by the Intercept.


In 10 pages, the DOD outlines what its looking for in an ad agency partner and what it hopes to achieve with a digital campaign focused on high schools. The “primary objective,” according to the contract document: To reach teenagers and generate “qualified leads of potential applicants for enlistment while also raising awareness of the Georgia Army National Guard.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Via location tracking, geofencing, and monitoring individual students’ phone activity, the state National Guard branch plans to beam banner ads, video advertisements, and other material to kids’ devices across social media and streaming platforms. Specifically, the ads will be plastered across Instagram, Snapchat, music apps, and TV streaming sites. Notably, TikTok is excluded from this list because of a ban on DOD use.

Using geofencing (i.e. virtual perimeters that marketers can employ to target their ads to devices within a small geographical area), the DOD intends to spam recruitment ads to phones within a mile radius of each school. Students are the target, but the Georgia National Guard is also interested in reaching school counselors and parents—who could presumably help sway teens in their decision making processes.

In total, the Georgia military organization, which is the sixth largest National Guard in the U.S., will test its recruitment ad scheme at 67 different high schools. As a secondary metric of success, the military is hoping to rake in more than 3.5 million views or “impressions” and thousands of clicks on its ads in first few months of the campaign’s launch, per the federal document.

The contract plan states that the state National Guard aims to reach 17-24 year olds (the document also references setting up ad campaigns at colleges, though offers no further specifics). However, it’s unclear whether the DOD plans to limit its ad audience to only older teens, as the document doesn’t mention age filters. Even younger teens and children at middle and elementary schools near to high schools could also end up inadvertently targeted by the National Guard ad campaign. Geographically targeting high schools could be a way “to bypass parental involvement in the recruiting process,” ACLU of Georgia lawyer, Benjamin Lynde, told the Intercept. Lynde himself reportedly enlisted in the Georgia National Guard in 2005, but said “parents should be involved from the onset.”

ADVERTISEMENT

On top of the location tracking necessary to enable geofenced ads, the DOD also plans to keep tabs on individual phone identity and activity to “retarget” ads, once a user has engaged with its material. In other words, if a teenager clicks on one of the banner ads they’re sent and ends up on a National Guard landing page, the military will then double down and send even more targeted material to the teen’s phone. And the ads won’t just stay at school or on specific apps. Retargeting will also allow the campaign content to follow teens home and to other websites, according to the Intercept.


The contract is dated from February 2023, and mentions an active ad campaign being in place before September. However, it’s unclear which, if any, ad agency won the DOD bid. The plan outlined in the contract is “in its infant stages,” said a Georgia National Guard spokesperson in a phone call with Gizmodo. The spokesperson added that they didn’t believe any company had received the contract yet, but could not definitively confirm that. Currently, they said, the Georgia National Guard hasn’t employed geofenced ads in the state’s high schools. However, the military force still uses other means to “reach out to the younger audience,” including phone, email, social media, and face-to-face recruiting events.

Gizmodo reached out to the DOD, and the Georgia Department of Education for more information, and did not hear back by publication time.

The plan implied by the federal contract doc is far from the first time the U.S. military has targeted teenagers and high schools. Teen recruitment has been a longstanding strategy across defense branches, and many public and private schools host recruitment events. In fact, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 made it mandatory for schools receiving federal funding to provide military recruiters with student contact information upon request.

Nor is it the first time that the DOD has sought to entice enlistees through controversial digital means. Through chatbots and Twitch streams, the U.S. military has aimed to boost its public perception and attract new sign-ups via the internet for years.

Yet the Georgia National Army Guard contract is a particularly illuminating glimpse into how ad tech and armed forces can come together in unsettling ways. Already, geofencing has enabled personal injury lawyers to target emergency room visitors, anti-abortion groups to spam people inside Planned Parenthood clinics, and political groups to hone in on protestors. Now, not even public schools are safe from the creep of location-based ad-targeting. And not even children are safe from military recruitment.

4/17/2023,Netflix's Rivals Gleefully Mock Disastrous Love Is Blind Reunion Livestream,"Screenshot: Jody Serrano / Gizmodo / @LoveIsBlindShow

Netflix’s competitors—Bravo, Hulu, and more—giddily made fun of the streaming service’s livestream woes on Sunday as it struggled to air its much-hyped Love Is Blind season four reunion. Netflix ended up canceling the livestream, its second-ever live event, and told fans they would be able to stream it on Monday.

At first, Netflix appeared to simply be running late. In a now-deleted tweet, it informed fans that the livestream, which was scheduled to start at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday, would begin 15 minutes after the scheduled start time. However, many fans were unable to watch the reunion even at the new time. TechCrunch reported that Netflix displayed an error message when users tried access the livestream, which read: “There’s an issue with the livestream. Hang tight! We’re trying to fix it as soon as possible.”

ADVERTISEMENT

In addition, Downdetector, an outage tracking service, reported a huge spike in users reporting problems with Netflix around the scheduled time of the premiere. Although some users were apparently able to watch the reunion on Netflix, more than 9,200 users self-reported that they were experiencing problems with the platform.

The dinosaur Blockbuster, which only has one remaining store in the U.S., was the first one to throw salt on the wound.

“Remember renting vhs’ from us. You could start it on time no problem… This is what we get,” Blockbuster tweeted in response to Netflix’s now-deleted tweet announcing the 15-minute delay.

ADVERTISEMENT

Redbox joined in shortly afterwards. Redbox told Blockbuster in response, “solidarity, bro.” The company’s Twitter bio reads: “we still exist. thanks for asking.”

Then came the king of reality TV and reunions: Bravo. “We would never keep you waiting for a Reunion 😉” the network tweeted.

ADVERTISEMENT

Hulu, meanwhile, simply tweeted a photo of Kerry Washington with a delivering a judgmental “Hmm.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Netflix finally pulled the plug on the livestream an hour and 15 minutes after its scheduled premiere, telling viewers the reunion would be available to stream globally on Monday at 9 a.m. ET.


ADVERTISEMENT

“To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned,” the streamer said on Twitter. “We’re filming it now and we’ll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Gizmodo reached out to Netflix for comment on Monday morning but did not immediately receive a response.

Netflix’s Love Is Blind reunion was supposed to be another step forward in the platform’s experimentation with livestreaming, an idea it announced last year in response to declining subscriber numbers. The platform successfully debuted its first live event, Chris Rock’s Selective Outrage comedy special, in March and saw it reach its global top 10 chart.

ADVERTISEMENT

Although Netflix’s fortunes appear to be improving as of late, this hiccup with Love Is Blind likely won’t earn it any goodwill. Luckily, millions seem to be hooked on the show—30 million households watched its first season—so I bet they’ll bite their tongue and forgive Netflix, for now.",https://gizmodo.com/netflix-cancels-love-is-blind-season-4-reunion-delay-1850343050
4/14/2023,Montana Just Passed the First State TikTok Ban,"Photo: Dan Kitwood (Getty Images)

Montana made history on Friday by becoming the first state legislature to approve a wholesale TikTok ban affecting nearly all devices in the state. The first-of-its-kind ban, which goes far beyond previous state efforts banning the app on government devices, could set the precedent for a wave of TikTok bans in other Republican-led states. Widespread TikTok bans, for better or worse, could become a reality.

The state’s House of Representatives voted in favor of the bill, called SB 419, by a margin of 54-43 on Friday afternoon. Montana’s state senate already approved the bill back in March, meaning the only thing preventing it from becoming law is a signature from governor and known journalist body-slammer Greg Gianforte. Once signed, the ban will take effect in January 2024. However, the bill would become void if Congress enacts its own national TikTok ban. The bill also wouldn’t apply if TikTok divests its US business from Chinese ownership.

ADVERTISEMENT
How would the ban work?

SB 419 prohibits TikTok from operating “within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana,” over fears the app could be manipulated by the Chinese government for espionage purposes. If TikTok or app stores violate the law, Montana’s Department of Justice could slap them with penalties of up to $10,000 per day for the length of the violation. Those fines would apply to entities facilitating TikTok’s download rather than the app’s users.

“TikTok endangers the safety of Montanans and Americans at large,” Montana state Sen. Shelley Vance, one of the bill’s primary authors said according to KTVH. “We know that beyond a doubt that TikTok’s parent company ByteDance is operating as a surveillance arm of the Chinese Communist Party and gathers information about Americans against their will.”

It’s worth noting here that while numerous lawmakers and intelligence agencies have justified banning TikTok out of national security concerns, there’s still no concrete evidence the Chinese government has even used TikTok to surveil American users. But previous reporting has shown ByteDance employees in China can and have been able to view US user data.

ADVERTISEMENT

In an email to Gizmodo, a TikTok spokesperson said the bill amounted to censorship and would almost certainly be challenged by courts.

“We will continue to fight for TikTok users and creators in Montana whose livelihoods and First Amendment rights are threatened by this egregious government overreach,” a TikTok spokesperson told Gizmodo.

ADVERTISEMENT

Opponents of the Montana bill like the ACLU say it would violate the First Amendment and be a disaster for freedom of expression. In a letter sent to lawmakers earlier this week, the ACLU and five other civil liberties organizations said they had failed to prove TikTok poses any immediate harm to Montana residents.

“Montana’s TikTok bill is censorship, plain and simple,” ACLU senior policy counsel Jenna Leventoff said in a statement. “Montanans deserve better than to have their representatives violate their free speech rights by cutting them off from a unique platform that allows them to speak their minds, exchange information, and learn new things.”

ADVERTISEMENT
Did Montana just pave the way for a nationwide ban?

By approving the nation’s first TikTok ban, Montana may have just given a green light to Republican lawmakers across the country to push forward with their own copycat bills. If that happens, TikTok may have no choice but to agree to a forced spinoff of its US business currently favored by the Biden Administration.

ADVERTISEMENT

A patchwork of state TikTok bans could also encourage lawmakers in Congress to rip the band-aid off and pursue its own federal TikTok ban. While that seemed unlikely just a few months ago, lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle seemed united in their aggressive stance towards TikTok during a combative hearing with the company’s CEO last month. There are currently around half a dozen bills floating around D.C. that, one way or another, would end up with TikTok banned.",https://gizmodo.com/montana-just-passed-the-first-state-tiktok-ban-1850338398
4/14/2023,The Smart Gun Arms Race Is Here With First Commercially Available Firearm,"Image: Biofire Technologies

After decades of hype, biometrically enabled “smart” guns are officially on the market. Colorado-based Biofire Technologies this week said it released the first commercially available smart handgun which uses a fingerprint and facial recognition biometrics identity verification tool to unlock a 9mm handgun intended for home defense. The release could set off a new arms race among smart gun manufacturers eager to cash-in on a gun-addicted nation rattled by a horror-show of accidental and unnecessary firearm deaths.

Biofire, like other smart gun startups, claims its reliance on biometrics to unlock firearms could play a key role in preventing accidental suicides, particularly among children. Firearms, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were the number one cause of death for children in 2020. Gun-related deaths generally saw their highest peak the same year, with 45,222 firearm-related deaths recorded in the U.S. alone. Smart guns as a concept isn’t new by any means, but Biofire believes its model is the first one that will actually work as intended while still preventing unauthorized access.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We’ve applied high-precision engineering principles to make a meaningful impact on preventable firearm deaths among children,” Biofire founder and CEO Kai Kloepfer said in a statement

How does the smart gun work?

Biofire’s promotional material shows videos of a family running around their house with the firearm causally locked in its dock atop a bookshelf. In the videos, the 9mm handgun could almost be mistaken for one of many appliances left charging on a shelf overnight. The company claims its smart gun, “locks the moment it leaves your hand,” making it basically little more than a paperweight in unauthorized users’ hands. The gun’s owners can add or remove “trusted users” while the gun rests on its Smart Doc in a process reminiscent of adding fingerprints or face scans to unlock an iphone.

Screenshot: Biofire Technologies

For those who are authorized, the smart gun reads the user’s fingerprint and scans their face the moment they grab the gun, eliminating the need for a code or key to unlock it. Those two biometric systems verify a user’s identity independently—whichever one verifies the identity first unlocks it first. Biofire claims a user’s biometric data is stored on the gun and never leaves it. The firearm itself is powered by a rechargeable battery and reportedly uses encryption to prevent bad actors from retrofitting it into a traditional firearm. Gun owners interested in purchasing the $1600 pistol can customize its polymer and trigger colors much like customizing a pair of Nike sneakers or a Domino’s pizza.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Your Smart Gun only fires for the people you choose, so your firearm can never cause a tragic outcome in the hands of a child, criminal, or anyone else,” the company claims.

Why are smart guns up for sale now?

Besides acting as a safeguard against accidental child suicides, there’s another clear draw for smart guns: limiting mass shootings. A recent spate of mass shootings across the U.S. has left communities and lawmakers, once again, clambering for legislative reforms. Republican lawmakers have basically admitted new gun restrictions or regulations are off the table. It’s in that total absence of responsibility that smart guns could theoretically provide some relief.

ADVERTISEMENT

Biometric identifiers like fingerprint scanners or facial recognition could make it much more difficult for minors or those unable to legally acquire a gun to carry out attacks with borrowed or stolen firearms. Such safety measures, for example, could have played a preventative role in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting where the gunman used his mothers’ weapons to carry out the attack. At the same time, recent research from the National Institute of Justice determined the vast majority (77%) of mass shooters between 1966 and 2019 purchased at least one legal firearm used to carry out their acts of violence. More than 80% of the people responsible for shootings at K-12 schools, however, did steal guns from their families. In other words, smart guns could help reduce mass shootings, especially in schools but it likely won’t really make a dent in addressing the wider problem of easily accessible guns.

The less exciting, but more likely explanation for why smart guns are starting to hit store shelves is that gun owners are finally ready for them. More than half (56%) of U.S. gun owners surveyed in a Morning Consult poll last year said they supported the development of smart guns while 55% said they would feel comfortable using one. Those figures are a far cry from surveys carried out just two years earlier where only 19% of gun owners expressed even slight interest in buying a smart gun. Even though the underlying technology empowering smart guns has existed for years, major gun lobbies like the National Rifle Association have fiercely lobbied against them to the point where it even led boycotts against legacy gunmakers Remington and ​​Smith & Wesson when they tried to pursue the tech. Now, nearly twenty years later, the tides appear to be turning.

ADVERTISEMENT

“It’s been around a long time now,” LodeStar Works President and CEO Gareth Glaser said when asked about gun owners’ newfound acceptance of smart guns. “Everybody uses one form or another of authentication technology on their smartphone.”

Biofire’s new smart gun will have plenty of competition soon. Multiple startup smart gun manufacturers, including LodeStar Works and the unfortunately named SmartGunz LLC are both planning to release their models which rely on a mix of fingerprints and radio frequencies for identity verification in the near future.",https://gizmodo.com/smart-gun-firearm-biofire-technologies-1850337102
4/14/2023,Parler's New Owner Is Putting the Platform on Hiatus,"Parler is set to be shut off and then relaunched under new ownership.

Parler is apparently getting another lease on life, but first it has to die. The “free speech alternative” social network, popular among conservatives and the likes of Alex Jones, officially has a new owner. And that new owner has put the site on hiatus for an unspecified length of time.


Parlement Technologies Inc. has entered an agreement to sell off its social platform to Starboard, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Starboard is a digital media company formerly known as Olympic Media run by founder and CEO Ryan Coyne. The company already owns conservative news sites like American Wire News and BizPac Review, according to WSJ.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Starboard (Formerly, Olympic Media) announced today that it has concluded the acquisition of Parler, the world’s pioneering uncancelable free speech platform,” the company wrote in a press statement that took over the Parler homepage on Friday.

Navigating to the Parler.com website currently just displays this press release.

Upon announcing the completed acquisition of Parler, Starboard seemingly took the site offline. Coyne told the WSJ that he intends to keep Parler’s app and web platform on pause while Starboard concocts a plan to revive it bigger and better than before. “It’s going to take a breath of fresh air,” he said. But regardless of any challenges, the company believes that acquiring Parler is a net good. It’s a chance to offer “unsupported online communities by building a home for them away from the ad hoc regulatory hand of platforms that hate them,” Starboard wrote in its press statement.


“Parler app as it is currently constituted will be pulled down from operation to undergo a strategic assessment,” that statement adds. Starboard offered no details on timeline or how long Parler would be down for—nor information on what any revived version of the platform might be.

ADVERTISEMENT

In an email to Gizmodo, Coyne said. “there is not currently a defined timeframe for the launch of what Parler will transition into.” The Starboard CEO added that his company “is not disclosing exact plans for [its] use of the platform at this time.” Though, asked if existing Paler accounts and data will be preserved, Coyne said, “yes.”

As part of the transition, current Parler CEO George Farmer is stepping down. Igor Shalkevich, the company’s chief development officer, will take over the head exec position, per WSJ. The companies are keeping the financial terms of their deal under wraps for now.

ADVERTISEMENT

The newly announced acquisition comes months after a different deal with Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) fell through. In December 2022, Parlement Tech announced the choice to not sell to Ye on the same day that the mogul announced “I love Hitler” during an InfoWars appearance. As the parent company told Axios, the “decision was made in the interest of both parties,” and the company would “pursue future opportunities for growth and evolution of the platform for our vibrant community.”

In the intervening months between the failed Ye purchase and the present acquisition, Parler fell on hard times. And the platform had already been struggling. In January, Parlement Technologies laid off almost all of its staff—holding onto a skeleton crew of just 20.

ADVERTISEMENT

Parler has been around since 2018, when it emerged on the scene billing itself basically as Twitter but without moderation. Despite that attractive premise, the site failed to attract and maintain a user base comparable to more mainstream platforms. At its peak, Parler had a few million daily active users—compared to Facebook’s ~2 billion and Twitter’s ~230 million daily users.

Then, it all fell apart in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots. According to a vast ocean of critics, Parler enabled the planning of the Capitol chaos. The platform lost its web hosting when Amazon revoked its support for the site. Google and Apple followed by banning the Parler app from their stores. The social platform later returned to the internet hosted by Epik—digital cesspool rescuer extraordinaire. Then, Parlement Technologies announced its own pivot into web hosting.

ADVERTISEMENT

Still, Parler never recovered from its de-platforming. As of last August, the site’s visitor numbers were hovering around 137,000 per month. But Coyne and Starboard seem to have high hopes for the platform’s future. The media exec told WSJ he plans to maintain Parler’s audience, even in face of a site shutdown and growing competition among conservative social platforms. “Starboard is the perfect home for the Parler brand and its longtime loyal users,” the company’s press statement says.",https://gizmodo.com/parler-social-media-ye-conservatives-1850336373
4/13/2023,FBI Arrests 21-Year-Old Airman in Connection with Pentagon Leaks,"Photo: II.studio (Shutterstock)

A Massachusetts service member who has been described as both a “young, racist gun enthusiast” and an internet “troll” has been arrested in connection with the series of national security leaks that have roiled the U.S. government over the past week.

On Thursday, the FBI took Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard member, into custody in connection with the massive breach of government secrecy. A news helicopter captured video of the raid on the suspect’s home—revealing images of the handcuffed twenty-something being led from his house by heavily armed federal agents:

ADVERTISEMENT

During a short press conference, Attorney General Merrick Garland confirmed that Teixeira had been arrested in connection with the “alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information.” Garland further commented that Teixeira had been taken into custody “without incident.”

Teixeira is scheduled to make an initial appearance at the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Friday.

Who is Jack Teixeria?

NBC reports that Teixeira currently holds the rank of airman first class and has been stationed at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod. His official title is “cyber transport systems journeyman” and the Washington Post has said that it is Teixeira’s role as an IT technician that allowed him access to sensitive classified information.


ADVERTISEMENT

But at the same time that Teixeira seems to have had a job important enough to make him privy to highly guarded government secrets, he also apparently moonlighted as a juvenile internet troll—and that’s where he seems to have gotten himself into massive amounts of trouble. Under the charming internet handle “jackthedripper,” Teixeira is said to have been the admin of a gaming and “gun enthusiast” community hosted on the messaging app Discord. It’s in this gaming group—dubbed “Thug Shaker Central”—that Teixeira is alleged to have leaked large tranches of highly classified material.

Why, exactly, was he doing this? Supposedly to “impress” the other members of the group—many of whom were teenagers, the New York Times has reported:

Airman Teixeira oversaw an online Discord group named Thug Shaker Central, where about 20 to 30 people, mostly young men and teenagers, came together over a shared love of guns, racist online memes and video games.

ADVERTISEMENT

Just how did a doofus like this get his hands on highly sensitive government documents? It’s safe to say that we currently have no idea and we might have to wait for an entirely different kind of government leak to find out.

4/13/2023,"Kids on BeReal Are Exposed to Sexual Content More Often Than Other Social Networks, Survey Finds","Photo: Leon Neal (Getty Images)

BeReal, a popular new spontaneous image-sharing app designed to show life, “without filters,” had the highest proportion of child users exposed to sexual content of any major social media app, according to a new survey shared with Gizmodo. Larger apps like YouTube and TikTok had more overall incidents of exposure to sexual content, but users on BeReal were the most likely to actually interact with the content, the survey found. Similarly, the survey of parents showed BeReal had the highest proportion of child users who have shared sexually explicit images of themselves on the app.

Those findings are part of a large survey of US parents conducted by ParentsTogether Action, a nonprofit organization that advocates in favor of tougher online protection for teens and kids. The survey of 1,000 parents found instances of child sexual abuse and exploitation on every major social network. More than a third (34%) of parents surveyed said they believed their children had been exposed to sexually explicit content online. More than 40% of the kids exposed to sexual content at the time were under 12 years old. One in five were nine years or younger. ParentsTogether Action previously sent a letter to Meta and TikTok demanding meetings over the problem of child suicide after documents showed Mark Zuckerberg was informed of harms suffered by young users.


ADVERTISEMENT

“My kids, who are both in high school, have definitely been exposed to inappropriate content (sexual and otherwise) on Instagram and Snapchat.” said Holly Cook, a mother who responded to the survey. “It’s nearly impossible to stay on top of what they are seeing and talk about it with them so they don’t normalize the words and images.”

BeReal and TikTik—the two top social networks named in the survey—did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment. YouTube, which came third on that list, told Gizmodo it removes sexually explicit content and other content targeting children or families that contains “mature sexual themes.” Content that endangers minors’ emotional and physical well-being, the spokesperson added, is prohibited under its child safety policy. YouTube additionally may age restrict certain content that does not technically violate its polices but is deemed inappropriate for users under 18.

“Additionally, we age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 and have established quality principles for kids and family content to guide our recommendation system,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Accounts belonging to people under 13 must be on YouTube Kids or supervised experiences, and for these accounts, we provide parents with a range of options and tools to control what their families do and see online.”

Parents surveyed say social media use is basically ubiquitous among kids. 97% of the parents surveyed, who all had children under the age of 18, said their kids use social media. A majority, 60%, said their children use social media every multiple time per day. Responding parents also said 1 in 3 children were exposed to social media online before the age of five years old, despite most platforms setting minimum sign-up age requirements at 13.


The disturbing findings highlight not only the pervasiveness of sexual material on social networks with young users but also potentially expose glaring gaps in tech moderation practices. With dozens of new child online safety bills climbing their way through state legislatures and Congress, the survey could serve as a catalyst by advocates to pressure tech companies and lawmakers.


ADVERTISEMENT

Children who used social media the most frequently were also more likely to come across sexually explicit content, the group found. Kids with disabilities and others identifying as LGBTQ were also significantly more likely to receive sexually explicit requests, according to the survey.


The survey shows young users on tech platforms are still regularly coming in contact with adult strangers despite years of pushback on the issue from parent groups. 30% of the parents surveyed said their child had been contacted by a stranger online while another 24% said they simply weren’t sure. Nearly half, (47%) of the children contacted by a stranger were 12 at the time. Around 10% of the parents said they believed a stranger had made a sexually explicit request of their child. One parent described a particularly disturbing interaction on Roblox.

ADVERTISEMENT

“On Roblox, there were grown men trying to talk to my daughter. Ask when she was alone,” Delila Gonzalez, a mother who participated in the survey said. “I was reading the messages between the two and knew it was a grown man because he would call my daughter ‘my little dove’. So now none of my daughters are allowed on that game and we do regular monthly phone checks.”

Kids online safety bills are coming

Parents responding to the survey were unified in their support for change. The vast majority (93%) said they did not think social media companies were doing enough to keep kids safe from child exploitation or abuse online while another 95% said they support stronger laws to regulate social media. Though parents called for a variety of new safeguards, their most common request was for social media platforms to provide parents with stronger and more accessible parental controls.

ADVERTISEMENT

Dozens of child online safety bills are currently making their way through state legislatures, some more credible than others. Last Fall, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a first-of-its-kind measure forcing tech companies to put in place sweeping new safeguards for users under the age of 18. The law, called The California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, would pressure companies to default child users to privacy settings that take into account their mental health. The rules also prohibit tech firms from collecting, selling, or retaining a young person’s geolocation, and would prevent firms from encouraging children to provide more personal information. Though set to take effect in 2024, critics—Big Tech among them—worry broad law could lead to costly new age verification systems. Privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation fear the law could actually lead to more data collection by tech platforms.


Then just last month, Utah rushed through its own pair of child online protection laws requiring social media companies to verify users’ ages, obtain parental consent, and most notably set a curfew banning users under the age of 18 from using social media apps between 10:30 PM and 6:30 AM. Legal experts warn some of the Utah law’s provisions, which sound eerily similar to authoritarian measures in China, are guaranteed to face a tsunami of legal challenges.

ADVERTISEMENT

Regardless of how those two cases play out, online child privacy protections are no longer a question of if, but rather, when and how. Politico estimates at least 27 different kids’ privacy and safety bills have been proposed by 16 states since February.

That broad support for doing something when it comes to strengthening kids’ online protections could serve as a palpable middle ground for a deeply divided Congress. Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, according to Axios, intends to bring a handful of proposed child online safety bills to the senator floor for a vote in the coming months and has even expressed interest in a kid’s online safety and privacy themed week.

4/13/2023,Snapchat Is Expanding Its Music Library,"Snapchat unveiled Sounds to the masses in October 2020.

Snapchat is looking to expand its massive sound library—called SnapChat sounds—with a new deal between its parent company Snap and several major music distributors across the world.


Snap announced the news in a press release today, and explains that the plan is to bring more music to the Snapchat’s 375 million daily active users. Snap says that its new deal includes partnerships with UnitedMasters in the U.S., BUMA/STEMRA in the Netherlands, SUISA Digital Licensing AG and its subsidiaries across the world, and other unidentified direct-licensing music publishers. Snapchat hopes the move will bring more local artists’ music to its users’ Snaps, messages, and filters. The deal adds onto Snapchat’s pre-existing relationship with other, major and independent records labels like Universal Music Group, Distrokid, and Sony Music Entertainment.

“These partnerships will add local artists’ music to the Snapchat Sounds library, allowing Snapchatters more options to innovate and easily embed licensed music into their messages and Snaps across Snapchat’s platform and creative tools like augmented reality Lenses,” Snapchat announced in its press release.

Sounds is a feature on the Snapchat app that allows users to include music, sound bites from TV and movies, and their own audio clips into their messages, photos, or videos. Sounds operates in much the same way that TikTok allows users and musical artists to upload their own audio or songs to the platform for use in TikToks. The major difference between Snapchat and TikTok’s audio features is that all of Snapchat’s audio that contains music, or clips from TV and movies is officially licensed, whereas TikTok seemingly allows anyone to upload anything. A Snapchat spokesperson told Gizmodo in an email that the company has a system for removing copyrighted material from the platform in the event that music from the licensing deal is uploaded as a Sound.

Snapchat unveiled Sounds to the masses in October 2020, as reported by TechCrunch. The move was likely an attempt by Snapchat to recapture the magic of its rival TikTok, after TikTok exploded in popularity during the onset of the covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.

4/13/2023,"Twitter Partners with eToro to Let Users Buy and Sell Stocks, Crypto","Illustration: FellowNeko (Shutterstock)

Elon Musk’s Twitter, which the billionaire said this week is now being run by his dog, has closed a partnership deal with the online investing platform eToro, proving that the company might not be as radioactive as some people might think. 

The new partnership, which was announced on Thursday, expands Twitter’s $Cashtags feature and lets users search for more real-time prices for stocks, crypto, and other financial assets. Furthermore, users will now have the option to go to the eToro site directly from Twitter and invest in the asset they looked up. According to eToro, the new partnership with Twitter will allow it to “further financial education,” which is a polite way to say, “to make money.” 

ADVERTISEMENT

In a statement, eToro CEO Yoni Assia said that financial content on social media had provided education to many who felt excluded by more traditional channels.

“Twitter has become a crucial part of the retail investing community – it’s where millions of ordinary investors go every day to access financial news, share knowledge and converse,” Assia said. “There is power in shared knowledge and by transforming investing into a group endeavour, we can yield better results and become more successful, together.” 

Considering the fervor of retail investors on social media, the partnership could be a potential boom for eToro. Twitter currently sees an average of 4.7 million $Cashtag searches a day, according to information provided in the press release, and has seen 420 million $Cashtag searches since the beginning of the year. $TSLA (Tesla), $SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF), and $BTC (Bitcoin) were among the top five most searched $Cashtags on Twitter. 

Twitter launched the $Cashtag feature in December and previously linked to live price charts on Robinhood, a move that was met with skepticism from retail investors.

Despite intense criticism, Musk said in a surprise BBC interview on Tuesday that Twitter was “roughly breaking even” and that most of its advertisers had returned. The company’s financial health has no doubt been affected by Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting measures, including laying off swaths of people and declining to pay rent to some of Twitter’s landlords. None of that, however, appears to have stopped eToro from going into business with Twitter.

In a nod to the U.S. State of the Union, Twitter CEO Elon Musk gave his own ‘State of Twitter’ in a surprise interview with the BBC on Tuesday evening, claiming that Twitter was now being run by his dog, Floki, and that he had only bought the social media company for $44 billion because a judge was going to force him to do it, eliding the fact that he had agreed to do so in writing.

This week will mark the one-year anniversary of Musk’s first offer to buy Twitter in April of last year. Musk’s interview is one of the most extensive accounts he’s given about the company to the media, a frequent subject of his criticism and disdain, since he officially took over nearly six months ago. It covered a range of topics, from his work habits and Twitter’s mass layoffs to his current fight with the BBC and NPR over the platform’s “Government Funded Media” labels, which Musk said would be changed to “publicly-funded media” instead.

4/12/2023,Judge Says Fox News Can’t Argue Spreading the 'Big Lie' Was Newsworthy,"Frequent protesters from Rise and Resist stood in front of the Fox News building in New York City last month with signs citing court documents stemming from the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit.

Fox News is going to need to rethink its strategy and excuses for why it promoted the lies of the 2020 election deniers. On Tuesday, a Delaware judge said during a pre-trial hearing that Fox News won’t be allowed to try and convince jurors its promotion of the “big lie” conspiracy was all just regular journalistic practice covering a sitting president.


“Just because someone is newsworthy doesn’t mean you can defame someone,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis told Dominion and Fox’s lawyers, according to The New York Times.

As the start of Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation trial against Fox News next week looms ever closer, Davis set several restrictions surrounding what arguments both sides could bring up. For the voting machine company’s part, it’s not allowed to bring up the Jan. 6 insurrection, as reported by the Times. Davis reportedly told both sides that the central question for the trial was whether Fox knew the election denial claims were lies, but aired them anyway.

It’s a blow to both sides as they used those arguments in pre-trial work running up to the April 17 court date, though it’s a specific kick in the pants for the right-wing news network. Up until now, Fox News had relied heavily on the “newsworthiness” argument in its ongoing defamation lawsuit against Dominion Voting Systems. The right-wing news network has also argued that its coverage was protected under the 1st Amendment and was a necessary part of covering former President Donald Trump and his cronies. The judge reportedly allowed Fox to call on these free speech protections.

In March, Fox lost its bid to quash the lawsuit, though Dominion now has to prove to jurors the network knowingly promoted false information, a notoriously difficult threshold called “actual malice.”

Davis issued rulings on several motions during this last pre-trial hearing. According to CNN, Davis said Fox can’t use the few times its reporters actually fact checked Trump’s lies, as Davis said that “you can’t absolve yourself of defamation by putting someone else on at a different time.” Emails and texts from Fox News hosts and execs shown off during discovery showed how Tucker Carlson actively wanted Fox to fire reporter Jacqui Heinrich after she fact checked a Trump tweet.

ADVERTISEMENT

Fox is also barred from bringing up Dominion’s internal emails about staff complaints about how their voting machines “suck,” as since those internal messages weren’t public in 2020 and couldn’t have influenced Fox’s reporting. On the other hand, Dominion is cleared for bringing up Fox execs and hosts’ salaries. The voting machine company has argued those internal messages prove Fox and its chairman Rupert Murdoch was more concerned about network ratings than the truth.

Murdoch is the CEO of News Corp, Fox News’ parent company, and the chairman of Fox Corporation. During the pre-trial hearing, Dominion lawyers claimed Fox had concealed that Murdoch had a more official role as an officer at Fox News. Davis reportedly admonished Fox News for concealing that fact, as Dominion argued it would have taken a different tact during the pre-trial discovery step. For its part, a Fox spokesperson told CNN that Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman on Fox News SEC filings for years.

Judge Davis also told the court that he had received death threats for his role in the ongoing trial. Dominion’s lawyers also discussed how the voting machine company’s employees have also faced threats and harassment. Davis told the company it could mention the threats but not get into what those threats contained.",https://gizmodo.com/fox-news-dominion-voting-tucker-carlson-big-lie-1850327134
4/11/2023,Pentagon Classified Documents Leak Linked to Discord,"Image: rafapress (Shutterstock)

After a batch of classified documents were leaked from the Pentagon, it appears open-source intelligence analysts have pinned the leak down to an unlikely place: Discord. The documents were apparently used by patrons of the messaging platform, which is frequently used by avid video game players, in order to settle a debate about the ongoing war in Ukraine.

As detailed in The Wall Street Journal, at least 50 documents with Secret and Top Secret classification labels have surfaced so far. A Pentagon spokesperson told the Journal that the department was looking into the validity of the photographed documents “that appear to contain sensitive and highly classified material.” Reports show that the documents began appearing on Discord in January in a group of more than a dozen users, with potentially hundreds of documents appearing in the channel. Additional reporting by The Guardian revealed that this channel was named “Thug Shaker Central.”

ADVERTISEMENT

While the cache remained in this niche group of users, this past March, several dozen were  to a slightly larger group run by fans of the Filipino YouTuber WowMao. Ten of those several dozen were  to an even larger Discord channel focused on Minecraft called “Minecraft Earth Map” amidst a debate between two users. As of April 5, some of the documents were apparently altered and shared on 4chan as well as by a Russian propaganda account on the messaging app Telegram.

“It is Discord’s highest priority to ensure a safe experience for our users. When we are made aware of content that violates our policies, our Safety team investigates and takes the appropriate action, including banning users, shutting down servers, and engaging with law enforcement,” A Discord spokesperson told Gizmodo via email. “In regards to the apparent breach of classified material, we are cooperating with law enforcement.”

The documents allegedly contain specifics about the ongoing war in Ukraine. More specifically, the documents contain communications by U.S. allies including Israel and South Korea as well as details surrounding America’s penetration of Russian military plans. The documents possibly came from inside the U.S. military and also contain information on the size of Ukrainian forces, military equipment, and details of the support the U.S. has provided the country during the war.

Believe it or not, this is not the first time some video game fans have apparently leaked sensitive government documents in the midst of a heated debate. Players of the multiplayer combat game War Thunder shared specs of an F-16 fighter jet in a forum amidst an argument about specs in January 2023.",https://gizmodo.com/pentagon-leaked-documents-discord-russia-1850324107
4/11/2023,Instagram Founders' News App Artifact Adds 'Reputation Scores' and Comments,"Image: Courtesy of Artifact

Artifact, the personalized news sharing app founded by Instagram’s co-founders, has added comments and discussion on articles, marking the first public social components of the new app.


Users who want to leave comments on articles will have to create an Artifact account and add a verified phone number. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who started Instagram together, said in a press release the app is requiring users’ phone numbers in an effort to curtail spam and moderate content. Ideally, Systrom said he believes these protections should help prevent the platform from devolving into a toxic cesspool like other prominent news sharing apps. Krieger said the app encourages users on the platform to use their real names though they can still use pseudonyms.

Each new Artifact profile will be given a “reputation score” which can be increased or decreased based on upvotes and downvotes a user receives from other users on their comments. The reputation score is displayed next to their name. Comments will be ranked by an algorithm that takes into consideration a user’s reputation, the score of a given comment, and other signals. The company says it’s using “state of the art moderation AI models” to detect violating content. According to Artifact’s press release, the company will deploy artificial intelligence to moderate comments as well. Violating content will be removed and some users may be banned outright if deemed necessary.

“We believe the combination of these approaches will help us keep discussions more civil,” Systrom said in a press release.

What is Artifact?

Artifact is a personalized news reader revealed earlier this year, the brainchild of Systrom and Krieger after their departure from Meta, née Facebook. The app was initially released as an invite-only experience that required a US phone number. The app had a waitlist of 160,000 sign-ups at launch; its current user numbers are not publicly available.",https://gizmodo.com/instagram-founders-artifact-reputation-scores-comments-1850323907

After being convicted of wire fraud for her dealings with her failed blood startup Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes was hoping to remain free on bail while she appeals the decision. Unfortunately for her, a federal judge has denied her that luxury.


According to court documents filed on Monday, Judge Edward J. Davila of the U.S. District Court Northern District of California denied Holmes’ Motion for Release Pending Appeal. The court ruled that while Holmes is not a risk to her community as a nonviolent criminal and has shown no intention of fleeing, she has not presented new evidence that could lead to her appeal actually resulting in a reversal or new trial. As NPR notes, Holmes argued in her appeal that the products she promoted through failed biotech startup Theranos were not faulty, while the court argues that this does not address why Holmes was convicted, which is for several counts of wire fraud.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Although the Court finds that Ms. Holmes is not a flight risk or a danger to the safety of the community, it is unable to find that she has raised a ‘substantial question of law or fact’ that if ‘determined favorably to [her] on appeal, [would be] likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial of all counts on which imprisonment has been imposed,” the denial of appeal reads. “Based on the foregoing, Ms. Holmes’ Motion for Release Pending Appeal is denied.”

Holmes founded Theranos as a startup in 2003 after she dropped out of Stanford during her undergraduate education. Holmes touted the company’s ability to test a patient’s blood with a single drop using the company’s proprietary technology. The company eventually folded after whistleblowers from within Theranos tipped journalists at The Wall Street Journal in 2015, claiming that the company’s blood-testing technology didn’t work at all.

After a lengthy legal battle, Holmes was eventually found guilty on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Theranos investors, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Holmes was later sentenced to over 11 years in prison in November 2022.

After apologizing to the Bahamas ahead of a recent treasure hunting scheme, Fyre Fest mastermind Billy McFarland has some seemingly inevitable news for us all: Fyre Festival 2 is in the works.


McFarland announced the sequel to the disaster of a music festival that kinda sorta took place in 2017 in a tweet yesterday—less in the form of a teaser and more in the form of an outright confirmation. In his tweet, McFarland stated that “Fyre Festival II is finally happening” while asking those who read his tweet to pitch why they should be invited. Details are scant past that, with a timeline for the festival and whether or not any musical guests are interested in attaching their names to it currently unclear.

ADVERTISEMENT

McFarland did not immediately return Gizmodo’s request for comment.

Fyre Festival was a music festival set to take place in The Bahamas on April 28–30 and May 5–7, 2017. McFarland and rapper Ja Rule planned the festival, which was highly publicized by notable social media faces including Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski. The music festival, which allegedly booked 33 musical acts from Blink 182 to Lil Yachty, was expected to be a weekend of glamor, partying, and exclusive concerts for any trust fund kid willing to cough up the dough.

When the weekend of the festival arrived, it descended into chaos. Guests were taken aback by the lack of food, housing, and security (in contrast to the luxury accommodations they were promised) and many flights out of the remote part of the island were cancelled leaving people stranded—and Billy McFarland was at the center of all of the fallout. Afterward, McFarland was charged with wire fraud and faced 20 years in prison.

McFarland emerged from his publicity hidey-hole late last year to apologize to the Bahamas ahead of a treasure hunt referred to as PYRT, in which McFarland announced he would be hiding 99 bottles across the globe, and each bottle will have its own set of clues and treasure that hunters can find. In response, Aviation Chester Cooper, Bahamas Minister of Tourism, said that the country “will not endorse or approve any event in The Bahamas associated with [McFarland]” and that “he is considered to be a fugitive.”

4/9/2023,Monster Energy Tried to Make Pokémon Change Its Name Because of the Word ‘Monster’,"Photo: Robcartorres (Shutterstock)

Leer en español.

The company behind Monster Energy drinks is infamous for claiming that others are infringing its trademarks. In fact, a new report states that company isn’t been above threatening beloved video games like Pokémon and Monster Hunter because it believes that consumers could confuse the games with Monster Energy drinks.

A report  this week in Automaton, a Japanese media outlet, claims that Monster Beverage Corporation has complained over trademark registrations for Pokémon X, Pokémon Y, Pokémon Sun, and Pokémon Moon over the years, as well as the Monster Hunter brand and the videogame Monster Hunter Generations. The mobile game Monster Strike didn’t escape Monster Beverage Corporation’s all-seeing eye, either. The company opposed the game’s full title and its abbreviation, “Monst.”

ADVERTISEMENT

In Japan’s Patent Office, Monster Beverage Corporation has presented a staggering 134 trademark objections. In the U.S., meanwhile, it has more than 100 objections before the Patent and Trademark Office. Monster is partially controlled by Coca-Cola and has a $55 billion market cap.

Although the claim that someone could erroneously associate the Monster Hunter and Monster Strike video games with Monster Energy drinks is highly debatable and unlikely, you may be asking: What does Pokémon have to do with all of this? In the case of the Pokémon brand, Monster Beverage Corporation argued that the company’s brand presentation—in Japan, the series uses both its full title, Pocket Monsters, and its abbreviation, Pokémon—could cause people to mistakenly believe that the product was related to Monster Energy drinks.

As expected, these objections didn’t go anywhere, and Pokémon’s games went to market with their original names. However, this hasn’t been the case for all brands that have been attacked by Monster Beverage Corporation.

In 2020, Ubisoft changed the title of its videogame from Gods & Monsters to Immortals: Fenyx Rising after Monster complained that the original could be easily confused with its brand. At the end of March, the indie studio Glowstick Entertainment revealed that it was fighting against Monster Beverage Corporation in a case before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an effort to keep the name of its game: Dark Deception: Monsters & Mortals.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Monster Energy is a bully that is owned by CocaColaCo,” Vincent Livings, founder and CEO of Glowstick, said in a Twitter thread on March 29. “Do not support a bully company by buying their energy drinks. If nothing else, I hope they eventually learn that going after game studios is not in their best interest.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Livings stated that Monster Beverage Corporation tried to negotiate with him and proposed allowing the studio to use the name Monsters and Mortals in exchange for agreeing to never use any variation of “monster” in any other future game.

Monster Beverage Corporation has deep ties to the videogame industry and is a notable sponsor of streamers and events. Nonetheless, its harassment isn’t limited to those involved in the videogame industry. In the past, the company tried to get the Toronto Raptors, an NBA basketball team, to stop using a clawed up basketball as its team logo because it claimed it was too similar to its “M” Monster logo.

ADVERTISEMENT

The company also doesn’t differentiate between big and small companies when it presents a complaint. Last month, Monster Beverage Corporation sued a local Lebanese restaurant in Ohio for using its logo on the restaurant’s sign. More than 10 years ago, it fought a years-long legal battle with a group of fish keepers who belonged to an online forum called “MonsterFishKeepers” and wanted to sell merchandise with the forum’s name.

4/9/2023,Elon Musk Decides NPR Is Not State Propaganda After All,"Illustration: Jody Serrano / Gizmodo / Getty Images

Twitter CEO Elon Musk has decided that NPR is not the same as media outlets like China’s Xinhua News, which is a well-known state propaganda machine, after all, even though he classified them both as “state-affiliated media” on the social media network this past Wednesday. After receiving pushback from NPR, Musk debuted a new label for it this weekend: “Government Funded Media.” 

Musk changed NPR’s label quietly on Saturday, two days after telling NPR reporter Bobby Allyn that Twitter was still evaluating whether it made sense to stick a “state-affiliated media” label on NPR’s profile. According to its own rules, Twitter defines state-affiliated media as outlets where the state controls editorial content through funding or political pressure. Allyn tweeted on Saturday that Musk had told him Twitter would be applying the new “Government Funded Media” label to a “larger number of institutions.”

ADVERTISEMENT

PBS, the BBC, and Voice of America also had the new label on their profiles on Sunday. 

It’s not clear what NPR thinks of the new label, which is still inaccurate since NPR only receives about 1% of its funding from the U.S. government. NPR stopped tweeting on April 5 in protest of its “state-affiliated media” label, calling it a “false disclaimer.” NPR spokesperson Isabel Lara on Thursday said the outlet would not tweet again until the “state-affiliated media” label was removed.

Gizmodo reached out to NPR for comment on Sunday morning but did not immediately receive a response. The outlet has remained silent on Twitter.

Notably, Twitter has not explained what its new “Government Funded Media” label actually means. As of Sunday morning, clicking on the hyperlinked label “Government Funded Media” label takes you to a page on Twitter’s Help Center, which only provides information on government accounts, or accounts that act as the official voice of a country, and state-affiliated media. 

ADVERTISEMENT

Allyn, the NPR reporter, pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of the label in a tweet, stating that Tesla and Musk’s other companies, which have received billions in government subsidies over the years, did not have a label indicating they were government-funded businesses. 

ADVERTISEMENT

The BBC, on the other hand, protested its new label and said it was speaking to Twitter to try to resolve the matter as soon as possible, Deadline reported.

“We are speaking to Twitter to resolve this issue as soon as possible. The BBC is, and always has been, independent,” a BBC spokesperson told Deadline. “We are funded by the British public through the licence fee.” 

ADVERTISEMENT

The “licence fee” the spokesperson refers to is the £159 (about $197) flat fee all UK households pay to watch or record shows on regular TV or online via streaming platforms. The BBC collects those fees, the rate of which is set by the UK government, and uses it to pay for its shows and services, such as its website and radio station. In 2022, the BBC collected £3.80 billion ($4.7 billion) in licensing fees, or 71% of its funding. People who don’t pay the fees can be taken to court. 

At the end of the day, it’s clear that Musk is at a loss over how to label media outlets that receive funding from the public or the government, which means it’s highly likely we’ll see more inaccurate labels over the next few days and weeks.",https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-npr-new-twitter-label-government-funded-media-1850317011
4/7/2023,Polling the Internet: Disinformation or Not?,"Photo: Austin Nooe (Shutterstock)

This week, the New York Times reported that a tranche of classified material had leaked to the internet. The documents, which are purported to involve Pentagon and NATO military stratagems related to the Russo-Ukrainian war, were found on Twitter and the chat app Telegram. On Thursday, the Defense Department told the paper that it’s in the process of investigating just how these apparently secret plans ended up splashed across newsfeeds all across the web.

Before the Pentagon could clear that up, however, more documents leaked online. The Times reported Friday that “a new batch of classified documents” had spilled onto social media platforms. This time, the documents appear to have initially popped up on 4chan, the rightwing cess pool where digital diseases like QAnon have been known to fester. The new docs appear to cover a broader range of secretive material than the previous ones—allegedly detailing a host of “national security secrets” that involve not only the U.S.’s activities in Ukraine but also the Middle East and China.

ADVERTISEMENT

Something like this hasn’t happened in quite a long time. Julian Assange is behind bars and Edward Snowden is busy writing a Substack, so there aren’t a ton of digital whistleblowers out there to flush the government’s secret docs into public view. But as officials scramble to figure out what’s going on, a question has quickly emerged: are the documents in these leaks even legitimate?

Indeed, suspicions are swirling that the docs are not what they seem—and the Times is also reporting that both sides of the Russo-Ukrainian war have been referring to it as potential disinformation effort. But if that’s the case, then whose disinformation is it? And what are they trying to disinform us about?

Weirdly, the Pentagon has acknowledged that the documents “are legitimate Defense Department documents, but the copies appear to have been altered in certain parts from their original format,” the Times writes. These edited versions, according to DoD officials, “overstate American estimates of Ukrainian war dead and underestimate estimates of Russian troops killed.”

Ukrainians don’t seem totally convinced of the veracity of the documents, with the Times quoting a “senior Ukrainian official” who thought the leak was a “Russian ploy to discredit a counteroffensive.”

ADVERTISEMENT

But Russian media, too, would appear to be suspect. On RT.com, one of the nation’s most popular news outlets, an op-ed entitled “Here’s why the leaked ‘secret plan’ for a Ukrainian military offensive doesn’t add up” calls the docs “misinformation” and argues that the documents were “probably prepared and distributed” by “pro-Kiev analysts.” The Times also reports that “pro-war Russian bloggers” had suggested that the leak was part of a “disinformation effort” and a researcher that the Times talked to who studies Russian messaging said that “pro-Kremlin voices were saying the leak was an American or Ukrainian disinformation campaign.”

So, make of that what you will. From here, things look about as clear as mud.

The Justice Department told the Times that it’s opened an investigation into the leaks but has declined to comment further. I don’t think I’m going to hold my breath for any forthcoming results from that investigation but I am pretty damn curious to see what happens next in this little saga.",https://gizmodo.com/ukraine-china-middle-east-pentagon-classified-leaks-1850313624
4/7/2023,A McDonald's Exec Is Worried Elon's Tweets Are 'Perpetuating Racism',"Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris (Getty Images)

The Chief Marketing and Customer Experience Officer for McDonald’s reportedly told other advertising heavyweights that Elon Musk’s relentless shitposting in the name of free speech “is perpetuating racism.” The Mickey D’s exec is also concerned about the general chaos the Twitter CEO has caused and the threat he poses to the fast food chain’s brand. The statements were made ahead of a major marketing conference next week where Musk will try to convince rapidly fleeing advertisers to return to Twitter. He’s facing an uphill battle.

“For many communities, his [Musk’s] willingness to leverage success and personal financial resources to further an agenda under the guise of freedom of speech is perpetuating racism resulting [in] direct threats to their communities and a potential for brand safety compromise we should all be concerned about,” Tariq Hassan wrote in a leaked email exchange revealed by Semafor. “Further, all of us who lead our brand’s investments across platforms were required to navigate a situation post-acquisition that objectively can only be characterized as ranging from chaos to moments of irresponsibility.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The leaked email thread included executives from McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive, and the Albertsons grocery chain. Those executives are board members of MMA Global, the organization hosting next week’s “Possible” conference. Colgate-Palmolive vice president and general manager of consumer experience Diana Haussling echoed some of Hassan’s sentiments and expressed concerns about the “harmful and often racist rhetoric of Elon Musk.”

“While I am a huge supporter of free speech and enterprise we can not ignore the impact of such hate speech,” Haussling wrote. “I especially can’t ignore it as a black woman.”

Kristi Argyilan, Albertsons senior vice president of retail media, meanwhile, expressed concerns unhinged antics or statements by Musk at the conference could reflect poorly on the group’s reputation. Twitter’s VP of global sales and marketing, who was also on the email thread, didn’t defend Musk and instead proposed each of the executives meet with her boss individually.

McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive and Albertsons did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s requests for comment.

Elon and Twitter desperately needs advertisers

The advertisers’ concerned messages couldn’t come at a worse time for Musk and Twitter. Data shared with CNN earlier this year by SensorTower shows Twitter has 625 of the top 1,000 advertisers it had prior to Musk’s takeover in September. That massive exodus reportedly resulted in a 60% decline in Twitter’s monthly revenue from advertisers between October 2022 and the end of January. Advertisers have faced pressure from dozens of civil society organizations who called on them to cut ties with Twitter due over Musk’s change to the site.

4/7/2023,Investigation Finds YouTube Served New Teen User Almost 30 Andrew Tate Videos in Less Than 2 Hours,"Andrew Tate and his brother were arrested in December 2022 in Romania for sex trafficking.

After signing up to YouTube as a new, 13-year-old user, Sky News found that YouTube flooded the feed with Andrew Tate videos, despite the professional misogynist being banned from the platform. The report highlights criticisms that YouTube is algorithmically pushing young boys to become fans of the toxic influencer who’s facing human trafficking charges in Romania.


In their investigation, Sky News posed as the fictional user and scrolled YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to test whether or not those platforms would push content from controversial misogynist Andrew Tate and his equally awful brother, Tristan. After scrolling through YouTube Shorts for less than two hours, Sky News found nearly 30 videos featuring Andrew Tate and his brother that appeared in their account’s feed, with the frequency of Tate videos increasing as time went on. Tate was banned from the platform in August 2022 after gaining fame on social media for spouting misogynist viewpoints.

“Following careful review of content flagged by Sky News, we removed some channels for violations of our circumvention policy, which prohibits uploading content from a previously terminated channel,” Jack Malon, a YouTube spokesperson, confirmed to Gizmodo in an email.

Gizmodo opted to recreate the experiment by creating a brand new YouTube account posing as a 14-year-old boy (Google prevented a sign-up for a 13-year-old) named Joseph and scrolling through Shorts for 1 hour and 17 minutes. After scrolling through videos including a skit of a man coercing a woman to cheat on her husband with him in an airplane bathroom, a compilation of moments in women’s soccer that involved players in vaguely sexual positions, and vape tricks on a cable talent show, but Andrew Tate never came up.

Sky News also conducted the experiment on Instagram Reels and TikTok by setting up an account on those platforms for the same fake 13-year-old boy. The outlet said that Instagram Reels served up fewer Tate videos and none appeared on the TikTok account’s feed. Deliberately searching “Andrew Tate” on TikTok revealed dozens of videos both of his old content as well as some videos championing him. The search results on TikTok also include a warning message about hateful content.

Andrew Tate is a 36-year-old kickboxer turned social media personality who racked up millions of views, subscribers, and followers for spouting misogynistic views on his platform. After a meteoric rise to the upper echelon of content creators, for better or for worse, Tate and his brother were arrested in Romania in December 2022 for alleged human trafficking, along with two other suspects. Despite his arrest and ban from social media seemingly being the end of the Tate saga, his effects in teenage boys still linger. Teachers told Insider that teen and tween boys—some as young as 11 years old—are heralding Tate as an idol and talking about women in derogatory and misogynistic fashion in their own classrooms.",https://gizmodo.com/youtube-serves-teen-30-andrew-tate-videos-in-2-hours-1850309149
4/6/2023,Tesla Employees Have Been Sharing and Meme-ing Your Private Car Videos,"Photo: Jose Gil (Shutterstock)

Former Tesla employees are confessing to having shared, laughed at, played back in slow motion, and just generally had a great time watching the videos that were taken with customers’ in-vehicle cameras. Reuters reports that close to a dozen former employees have revealed that sharing drivers’ personal videos was one of their favorite pastimes at the office—a good way to stave off boredom and to keep their co-workers entertained.

Elon Musk’s cars come with a bevy of preinstalled cameras—some of which are mounted inside the car and some are stationed externally. Tesla says that these cameras are used to help guide its “Autopilot” function—the semi-automated mode of driving that allows a user to cede some tasks to the vehicle’s computer systems. When you agree to Tesla’s privacy policy, you agree to share this visual data—though the company states on its website that the cameras are “designed from the ground up to protect your privacy.”

As it turns out, one particular class of Tesla worker—what’s known as a “data labeler”—is tasked with watching these in-vehicle videos. Labelers watch the videos to help the company’s AI systems better identify particular objects that appear in them. The labelers haven’t just been passively viewing customer videos, however. To “break the monotony,” as one former employee put it, they also made a habit of sharing the most entertaining ones with colleagues via Slack-like internal messaging systems, Reuters writes.

“If you saw something cool that would get a reaction, you post it, right, and then later, on break, people would come up to you and say, ‘Oh, I saw what you posted. That was funny,’” one former staffer told the news outlet. “People who got promoted to lead positions shared a lot of these funny items and gained notoriety for being funny.”

What kind of videos would employees share? Former staffers remember stuff like “dogs, interesting cars, and clips of people recorded by Tesla cameras tripping and falling” all being big hits. In one popular video, the car’s owner—a man—approached the vehicle totally naked. In another instance, employees enthusiastically shared a video of a child on a bike getting hit by a car (the child and the bike “flew” in opposite directions, former employees said). Still another category of entertainment apparently involved crashes and road rage incidents. If Tesla owners’ had something funny or interesting stashed in their garage, those items would also typically end up being the subject of office banter.

“We could see inside people’s garages and their private properties,” a former employee told Reuters. “Let’s say that a Tesla customer had something in their garage that was distinctive, you know, people would post those kinds of things.”

One office in particular, located in San Mateo, reportedly had a “free-wheeling” atmosphere, where employees would share videos and images with wild abandon. These pics or vids would often be “marked-up” via Adobe photoshop, former employees said, converting drivers’ personal experiences into memes that would circulate throughout the office.


“The people who buy the car, I don’t think they know that their privacy is, like, not respected,” one former employee was quoted as saying. “We could see them doing laundry and really intimate things. We could see their kids.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Another former employee seemed to admit that all of this was very uncool: “It was a breach of privacy, to be honest. And I always joked that I would never buy a Tesla after seeing how they treated some of these people,” the employee told the news outlet. Yes, it’s always a vote of confidence when a company’s own employees won’t use the products that they sell.


Privacy concerns related to Tesla’s data-guzzling autos aren’t exactly new. Back in 2021, the Chinese government formally banned the vehicles on the premises of certain military installations, calling the company a “national security” threat. The Chinese were worried that the cars’ sensors and cameras could be used to funnel data out of China and back to the U.S. for the purposes of espionage. Beijing seems to have been on to something—although it might be the case that the spying threat comes less from America’s spooks than it does from bored slackers back at Tesla HQ.

ADVERTISEMENT

One of the reasons that Tesla’s cameras seem so creepy is that you can never really tell if they’re on or not. A couple of years ago, a stationary Tesla helped catch a suspect in a Massachusetts hate crime, when its security system captured images of the man slashing tires in the parking lot of a predominantly Black church. The man was later arrested on the basis of the photos.

Reuters notes that it wasn’t ultimately “able to determine if the practice of sharing recordings, which occurred within some parts of Tesla as recently as last year, continues today or how widespread it was.”

With all this in mind, you might as well always assume that your Tesla is watching, right? And, now that Reuters’ story has come out, you should also probably assume that some bored coder is also watching—potentially in the hopes of converting your dopiest in-car moment into a meme.",https://gizmodo.com/tesla-elon-musk-car-camera-videos-employees-watching-1850307575
4/6/2023,IT Firm Blames Rogue Ex-Employee for Whites Only Job Ad,"Image: Jirsak (Shutterstock)

A tech company is under fire for seemingly posting a job listing asking for white candidates only with a note saying not to publish that information. Arthur Grand Technologies reportedly posted an ad on Indeed for a business analyst position with the note “Only Born US Citizens [White] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, TX. [Don’t share with candidates],” Business Insider reported. The job listing has since been taken down.

Arthur Grand Technologies is an IT services firm based in Ashburn, Virginia and in a LinkedIn post, the company placed the blame on a former junior employee. In an initial company response, Arthur Grand wrote on LinkedIn, “We conducted an investigation and discovered that a new junior recruiter at our firm was responsible for the offending job posting. We have taken immediate action and terminated their employment for violating our policy,” Business Insider reported.

ADVERTISEMENT

However, the tech company later revised its response to say it was a former employee who had taken it upon themselves to post the listing through their own account, saying the job listing wasn’t authorized or posted by the company. Instead, the statement said the former employee had taken a past job listing and added “discriminatory language” before he “reposted it through his own account.”

A screenshot of the job listing was shared online and quickly went viral garnering outrage on social media. One person responded to Arthur Grand’s LinkedIn post on Reddit, questioning the company’s response. “In a different post, they claimed it was a new junior hiring rep who posted it and that that person has been terminated,” the person wrote. “I wonder if the junior recruiter was told to make the posting but didn’t realize s/he was supposed to remove that part before posting it. In that case, the junior recruiter is just a scapegoat.” Another person asked on Reddit if the job was listed by a former employee’s account, how was the company able to remove it?”

Other Reddit users called the job listing “illegal and nauseating,” while another person tweeted, “Every minority who ever applied for a position with Arthur Grand Technologies and was denied employment needs to lawyer up.”

Gizmodo attempted to reach out to Arthur Grand Technologies but the contact page on its website says it “doesn’t exist.”

ADVERTISEMENT

A federal law against discrimination of any kind including a person’s national origin, race, color, sex, etc. was issued in October 2000 and made it illegal to not hire an employee based on their background. The law introduced the equal opportunity clause that all companies are required to abide by.

Arthur Grand Technologies says it takes its equal opportunity protocols seriously, adding that employees are hired “without regard to race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, national origin, religion, or non-job-related disability.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Arthur Grand Technologies has reportedly called itself a minority-owned company. “The moment this was brought to our attention, we worked with the job portal to remove this offensive job posting,” the company wrote on LinkedIn. They added, “Necessary legal action has been initiated against the job poster.”",https://gizmodo.com/arthur-grand-technologies-indeed-tech-jobs-1850309176
4/6/2023,"Cash App Founder Begged for Help After Stabbing, Nearby Car Drove Away","Screenshot: MobileCoin

New, gut-wrenching details have emerged in the death of tech executive Bob Lee, the creator of Cash App: Lee, 43, screamed for help after getting stabbed and approached people in a parked car for assistance. The people in the car drove away.

According to the San Francisco Standard, which reviewed surveillance footage taken after the attack on the former CTO of Jack Dorsey’s Square, Lee was on the sidewalk of the 300 block of Main Street near the Bay Bridge, part of the city’s office-heavy financial district, in the early morning of April 4 when he walked up to a parked white Camry with its hazard lights on. The video footage showed Lee lifting up his shirt, an attempt to show the people in the car his stab wounds. The people in the car did not help him and drove away.

Lee collapsed to the ground after the car drove away, the Standard reported, then got up and continued walking up an empty street before falling once more. At 2:35 a.m., Lee called 911. By then, he had let a trail of blood in his wake.

“Help!” Lee screamed into his phone. “Someone stabbed me.”

The San Francisco police arrived to help him in less than six minutes, the Standard reported, and found Lee unconscious on the ground with two stab wounds to his chest. He was taken to the San Francisco General Hospital in critical condition, where he succumbed to his injuries.

In a statement on Wednesday evening, San Francisco Police chief Bill Scott expressed his condolences to Lee’s family and loved ones and denounced the violent incident.

“There is no place for this kind of violent crime against anyone in our city. I want to assure everyone that our investigators are working tirelessly to make an arrest and bring justice to Mr. Lee and his loved ones, just as we try to do on every homicide that occurs in our city,” Scott said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lee’s death is being investigated by the SFPD Homicide Detail and is still in its early stages, Scott explained. Because of the this, the department was not commenting on any evidence or circumstances related to the crime. The police chief encouraged anyone with information about the case to step forward.

When the news broke on Wednesday morning, some thought it wasn’t true. Dorsey confirmed the reports on nostr, his new social network.

“It’s real,” Dorsey said. “Getting calls. Heartbreaking. Bob was instrumental to Square and Cash App. STL guy.” Both Dorsey and Lee went to high school in St. Louis.

The violent incident was met with shock by the tech community and has raised alarm about safety in San Francisco. Mixed martial arts champion Jake Shields, a longtime friend of Lee, told NewsNation that the tech executive had decamped from San Francisco to Miami because the California city was “deteriorating.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“[Lee] did comment on San Francisco deteriorating, which is why he actually had just relocated to Miami,” said Shields. The fighter tweeted that his friend “appeared to have been targeted in a random mugging/attack” in a “good” part of the city. Police have not commented on the circumstances of Lee’s death, though the fact that he was found on a sidewalk lends credence to Shields’ speculation.

In response to Shields, Twitter CEO Elon Musk said violent crime in San Francisco was horrific and asked city leaders to act in response.

“Many people I know have been severely assaulted. Violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately,” Musk said in a tweet, going on to tag San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins.

Although Jenkins didn’t directly to reply to Musk, she addressed Lee’s death and said the city did not tolerate these “horrific acts of violence in San Francisco.” She also stated that no one who commits a violent crime in the city receives leniency, contrary to what Musk said.

“As a former homicide prosecutor, I have a deep understanding of how these investigations & prosecutions work. I direct our staff to ensure that cases are vigorously prosecuted,” Jenkins said in a tweet on Wednesday afternoon. “No one who commits a violent crime, or who’s a repeat offender are receiving overly lenient plea deals.”

Goldbard told Gizmodo in an email that Lee had first become involved with the company, which focuses on cryptocurrency and payments, as an investor and advisor before becoming later getting more involved.

Bob Lee, the 43-year-old creator of Cash App and former CTO at Jack Dorsey’s Square, now Block, was stabbed to death in San Francisco on Tuesday morning.

Lee’s death was reported by NBC Bay Area and TechCrunch and later confirmed by Dorsey in a post on his social network, nostr. The tech executive’s passing was also confirmed by his boss Joshua Goldbard, the CEO of MobileCoin, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency and payments company. Lee worked at MobileCoin as the chief product officer. No arrests have been made.

“Bob was a dynamo, a force of nature. Bob was the genuine article. He was made for the world that is being born right now, he was a child of dreams, and whatever he imagined, no matter how crazy, he made real,” Goldbard told Gizmodo in an email. “From large contributions to Android at Google, to being the first CTO of Square, in that time creating CashApp, and working with us here at MobileCoin, Bob surely had an impact that will last far beyond his short time on Earth.”

According to a statement from the San Francisco Police Department, the incident that took Lee’s life occurred at around 2:35 a.m. on the 300 block of Main Street, where they found a 43-year-old adult male victim “suffering from apparent stab wounds,” which were described by police as life-threatening injuries.

Police stated that despite efforts by first responders and medical personnel, Lee died from his injuries.

Over on nostr, users expressed shock that the news was real.

“It’s real,” Dorsey said. “Getting calls. Heartbreaking. Bob was instrumental to Square and Cash App. STL guy.”

Twitter CEO Elon Musk also weighed in on Lee’s death early on Wednesday. In response to a tweet from Jake Shields, a former world mixed martial arts champion, who expressed outrage that Lee, his friend, was killed in the “good” part of San Francisco.

“He was in the ‘good’ part of the city and appeared to have been targeted in a random mugging/attack. Fuck San Francisco,” Shields tweeted. Police said Lee was stabbed in the Rincon Hill neighborhood near the Bay Bridge to Oakland, a part of the city’s office-heavy financial district.

Musk told Shields he was sorry to hear about Lee’s passing and said he knew many people that had been “severely assaulted.”

“Violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately,” Musk said, going on to mention San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins. “Is the city taking stronger action to incarcerate repeat violent offenders @BrookeJenkinsSF?”

According to TechCrunch, Lee joined Block after spending a few years at Google working on Android. At Block, Lee focused on developing the company’s Android app and helped create Cash App.

Lee’s death is being investigated by the San Francisco Police Department’s homicide unit. No arrests have been made and the investigation is active, the police said in its statement.

“Here’s to the crazy ones. We will miss you Bob. We love you,” Goldbard said. “For now, MobileCoin will mourn. We turn our attention to honoring Bob’s legacy by holding his loved ones close.”

4/5/2023,16 Celebrities Who Won't Pay Elon for Blue Checks,"Photo: Kevin C. Cox (Getty Images)

The battle between Twitter CEO Elon Musk and the legacy verified accounts with blue checkmarks that for years made the platform attractive is at a standstill—for now, at least. April 1, the day Musk said he would remove checkmarks from anyone who didn’t pay $8 for Twitter Blue, came and went, but the blue checkmarks remained.

While some speculated that the delay was simply technical, given that there is no surefire way to remove batches blue checkmarks, I’m betting all those high-profile Twitter users railing against the change and declaring that they wouldn’t pay Musk $8 made the head honcho hesitate. Some of those cranky blue checkmarked users included LeBron James, Chrissy Teigen, and Ice-T.

“oh my god just take the checkmark already who cares,” Teigen tweeted on March 31.

On the media and organization side, The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, Insider, BuzzFeed, and Politico were nay on paying for blue checkmarks (Gizmodo also isn’t paying). The White House also does not plan to fork over the cash.

As Nathan Hubbard, Twitter’s former vice president of global commerce and media, put it: “tweets from high-profile people with blue checkmarks are Twitter’s lifeblood.” In fact, almost all of the engagement on Twitter happens with high-profile accounts, he explained.

“[W]hat Twitter is going to start doing [on April 1] flips the equation - it is going to ask its most important creators to *pay Twitter* instead of the other way around,” Hubbard tweeted on March 31. “If most OG blue checks stop tweeting in protest of being asked to pay to create the content that Twitter lives by…Twitter dies.”

So Musk held off. However, to save face, he simply made it more difficult to tell who had a legacy blue checkmark and who had paid for it with their Twitter Blue subscription. To be petty, Musk did take away the New York Times’ official checkmark.

“This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account,” read the new message that appears when you hover over a blue checkmark.

Responding to a tweet about the change reading “checkmate,” Musk replied with “😌,” the relieved face emoji. Confusion erupted among people with blue checkmarks across the platform, although at least some former critics thought it was OK.

“I can live with this. This is a good compromise @elonmusk,” actor William Shatner said in a tweet. “My best, Bill.”

4/5/2023,Privacy Executive Rob Leathern Is Out At Google. Now He Wants to Talk About AI.,"Image: Rob Leathern / Prisma

When people start complaining that your tech company is ruining the world, you hire a guy like Rob Leathern. He joined Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, just as the Cambridge Analytica scandal convinced the public that Facebook was an existential threat to democracy. During the 2020 election and coronavirus pandemic outbreak, Leathern led efforts to address privacy, misinformation, and other problems in Facebook’s advertising system. Right after the election, Google poached him, bringing Leathern on as vice president in charge of products related to privacy and security—just as regulators embarked a years-long effort to ramp up scrutiny on the search giant.

Now after two years at Google, Leathern is out. He tweeted that Friday was his last day at the company. Leathern agreed to hop on the phone with Gizmodo, and while he didn’t explain why he left Google or where he’s going next, he did have a lot to say about one topic: these days, the public face of big problems at big tech wants to talk about artificial intelligence.

ADVERTISEMENT

Leathern’s background gives him unusual insight on what must happen as the world wraps its mind around tools like ChatGPT and how businesses like OpenAI grow exponentially.

In the early 2010s, blind optimism and fast money in Silicon Valley shielded the tech giants from critics. Things are different now. Almost as fast as AI chatbots captured the public’s attention, we started talking about whether the technology will destroy us all. In the immediate future, companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft need to ramp up programs that allow them to say “we hear your concerns, but don’t worry, we’ve got it all under control.” Leathern knows how to run that kind of operation.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

Thomas Germain: Looking at the last few years of your career, you’ve been someone who jumped from company to company addressing some of the biggest societal issues in the tech world. How do you see the moment we’re living through with AI?

ADVERTISEMENT

Rob Leathern: Yeah. I joined Facebook to work on integrity stuff in 2017, and it kind of reminds me of the situation we were in then. AI sort of feels like social media did in 2015 or 2016, there was an opportunity to build a bunch of systems to address big problems, but no one was necessarily doing it yet. I think we’re at that same kind of inflection point, but we’re moving even more rapidly. I mean, these tools, by their very nature, have so many more feedback loops embedded in them. The pace of change is insane, so this is the right time to be thinking about this stuff.

TG: So I know you’re not a technical expert on AI, but as a tech insider, do you have any thoughts on exactly how far past the Rubicon we are?

ADVERTISEMENT

RL: I think there are people better positioned to answer that question than me, but what I can say is there’s an incredible amount of momentum that creates pressure for folks on both sides, and the incentive to move quickly worries me. There’s a lot of pressure for companies to keep making advances, figure out how to train the next model, or reach the next milestone.

Then what I’ve seen from my work on privacy and safety over the last six years is there’s pressure on the other side of the coin as well. Regulators are competing with each other too, and everybody wants to be seen as pushing back on these advances. In other words, there are competing incentives in every direction to move faster and less carefully than you might otherwise. At the same time, some companies also have pressure to hold some things back more than they might like to.

ADVERTISEMENT

TG: Right, there’s some real tension there. OpenAI has an incentive to move as fast as possible to prove its a leader. Older players like Google and Microsoft have demonstrated that they’re keeping up, but they have more of a responsibility to be seen as moving carefully and methodically.

RL: Yeah, it’s going to be really interesting to watch those dynamics play out. The bigger companies are under more scrutiny, so they have to move slower and have checks and balances in place. In some cases, that’s going to lead to talented folks getting frustrated and wanting to leave. Really, it’s the spillover effect of the past challenges they’ve had around issues like privacy and security, and the regulations that came out of it. That has a huge impact on their agility.

ADVERTISEMENT

TG: How do companies working on AI balance moving quickly and moving responsibly?

RL: We’re at this transition point where, you know, AI ethics researchers who’ve been writing white papers have been doing great work. But maybe now is the time to transition to folks who have more hands-on experience with safety, integrity, and trust. This is going to touch a lot of different areas. It can be things as seemingly small as monitoring the identities of developers in the API ecosystem [the systems that let outside companies access a tech company’s products]. That was one thing that came out of the Cambridge Analytica issue at Facebook, for example. You need to start getting those folks in place, and my supposition is that not they’re not quite there yet when it comes to AI at most of these big tech companies.

ADVERTISEMENT

TG: Looking at the conversation around AI, it seems like we’re having this conversation much, much earlier in the process than we did with social media ten years ago. Is that because we’ve learned some lessons, or is it because the technology is moving so fast?

RL: I think it’s a bit of both, and it’s not just the speed, but the accessibility of these systems. The fact that so many people have played with MidJourney or ChatGPT gives people a sense of both what the upsides and the downsides of the technology could be.

ADVERTISEMENT

I do think we’ve learned some lessons from the past, as well. and we’ve seen various companies create mechanisms to address these concerns. A whole generation of engineers, product managers, designers, and data scientists work on these societal problems in the context of social networks, whether its privacy, content moderation, misinformation or what have you.

TG: Like with so many of these issues, some—but not all—of the concerns about AI are vague and hypothetical. What are the big things you’re worried about?

ADVERTISEMENT

RL: Well everyone is so focused on the big changes, but I think it’s interesting to look at some of what’s going to happen on the micro scale. I think the problems are going to be a lot more subtle than we’re used to. Take the other side of deep fakes. We’ve heard about watermarking content from ChatGPT or image generators, but what are you going to prove that a picture you took is a real photo. Tagging pictures with location and some kind of personal identifier is one solution, but then you’re creating these new signals that can pose privacy issues.

Another non-obvious concern is that anyone can use the free versions of these tools, but the paid and more powerful versions are less accessible. AI could potentially be problematic from an equity perspective, creating yet another way for wealthy folks to have an advantage. That will play out with individuals, but also with businesses on the client side. This technology is going to further separate the haves and have nots.

ADVERTISEMENT

TG: Given the nature of this technology, it’s hard to imagine what regulators can even do about it. The business friendly government in the United States, for example, is not about to ban this technology. Is it too late?

RL: Well, there are requirements that you could think of that governments can put in place. Maybe you have to register your technology, for example, if you’re using more than x number of GPUs or whatever the right metric is. But you’re still going to have people who are running their unlicensed technology in a basement, and whatever scheme we come up foreign governments aren’t going to care. I think to a certain extent the toothpaste is out of the tube, and it’s going to be hard to put it back in there.

ADVERTISEMENT

TG: I’ve been reporting on privacy for the better part of a decade. In that arena, it feels like just in the past year regulators and lawmakers are truly grasping the digital economy for the first time. AI is an even bigger problem to wrap your heads around. Are you hopeful about the ability to regulate this space? The prospects feel pretty abysmal.

RL: We’re in for a very challenging time. I think we’ll end up with a patchwork of regulations that are just copy and pasted from other things that don’t play well with each other. But people are more attuned to the facts of this situation. I don’t think the right answer is to make some blanked statement that we need to slow things down, because again, less well-intentioned actors like China are going to move ahead.

ADVERTISEMENT

One interesting lesson that comes from working on privacy and security is that in the early days, you have folks that see just how bad the gaps are, and they fall on the side of shutting things down. But to be effective in these roles, you need to have an appreciation for both downside risk as well as the upside potential. I used to say you need to be kind of an optimistic pessimist. There’s an opportunity to create rules, policies, and implementations that can actually allow the good stuff to flower while still reducing the harms.

TG: That’s a pretty industry-friendly perspective, but you’ve got a point. Our government is not about to shut down OpenAI. The only hope is a solution that works within the system.

ADVERTISEMENT

RL: Right. If you take the ‘shut it all down’ approach, well, among other things it’s just not going to happen. You need the adversarial folks, but you need optimists in your portfolio as well. And look, the other thing that also is true is it’s really hard, right? Because you’re creating stuff that hasn’t existed before. There aren’t always great analogs to something like ‘how do I make a given tool private?’ And like I used to say when I was speaking on behalf of Facebook, you’d be truly amazed at how innovative the bad guys could be. They do incident reviews too. They share knowledge and data. It’s going to be an incredibly adversarial space.

TG: I want to ask you about a completely different topic if you’ll indulge me, and that’s TikTok. What I’ve been saying in my reporting is a lot of concerns are overblown, and discussions about banning TikTok or ByteDance seem like a useless exercise given how leaky advertising technology is. But you’ve got perspective from inside the tech business. Am I wrong?

ADVERTISEMENT

RL: Your take accords with my feelings about this. Look, it’s important to, you know, ask questions about the ownership and the structure of these organizations. But I agree, the idea of a ban isn’t going to have all the benefits that some people presume it would. Companies like TikTok need to have a better story, and a better reality, about ownership and control, and where people’s data is going, and what the oversights and controls are. But banning it doesn’t sound like the right solution.

TG: On the other hand, you hear TikTok going on and on about this ‘Project Texas,’ where they plan on housing all the data on servers in the US. And sure, it’s a fine idea, you might as well. But talking about the physical location of a server as though that should reassure anyone seems ridiculous. Does that feel meaningful to you?

ADVERTISEMENT

RL: These systems are complicated, and saying oh it’s all on server X versus server Y doesn’t matter. What would be more reassuring is the additional oversight, but then again, those things are pretty challenging to set up too. People are looking for a level of certainty on this issue that’s hard to come by. In fact, any certainty we do get may just be hallucinatory.

4/4/2023,12 Wild Moments From Trump's Historic Indictment Day,"Image: Kena Betancur (Getty Images)

Well, the day has come. As much of the country waited on pins and needles over the past few weeks for the indictment of twice-impeached former president Donald Trump, Tuesday, April 4, 2o23 became the day that Trump officially was arraigned in Manhattan.


Naturally there was plenty of pushback from Trump’s supporters, who appeared in Manhattan in a crowd that was less than a fraction of what could have potentially been January 6: Part 2. The protests occurred both at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan and at the Manhattan Criminal Court in Lower Manhattan following Trump’s arrival in the city yesterday. In a city as liberal as New York, counter protests were also fruitful, with surprise appearances by Republican senators—and Trump lackies—Marjorie Taylor Greene and George Santos being cut short by those not interested in putting up with their hot breath.

After Trump migrated from Trump Tower to 100 Centre Street in Downtown Manhattan, he sat in a court room with his legal counsel. There, he pled not guilty to 34 felony charges, sending his case to a trial.",https://gizmodo.com/donald-trump-indictment-marjorie-taylor-greene-1850299224

Tanner Cook, a 21-year-old YouTuber, was shot at Dulles Town Center in Virginia on Sunday while attempting to film a prank video, per Cook and family member accounts.


Following the shooting, Cook was in the intensive care unit as of Monday, receiving treatment after the bullet pieced his stomach and liver, according to a report from WUSA9, a local CBS News affiliate station.

Police arrested the suspect, 31-year-old Alan Colie, in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Colie faces charges of aggravated malicious wounding, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and discharging a firearm within a building, per WUSA9.

Sheriff Mike Chapman told the news outlet that the shooting occurred during a fight in the mall food court between Cook and Colie. Cook reportedly approached Colie while a friend recorded video. It was supposed to be a light-hearted joke, by Cook’s account, but “this guy didn’t take it very well,” the injured content creator told WUSA9 from his hospital bed. “I was playing a prank and a simple practical joke,” Cook said.

“They were making a video at the mall and trying to have fun with people and this guy wasn’t having fun,” added Cook’s father, Jeramy Cook, to WUSA9. “There was a phone that was around him and they were interviewing or talking to him, and he didn’t like it and he pulled out his gun and shot my son.”

After the shooting, Dulles Town Center was closed for the remainder of the weekend. The mall re-opened on Monday.

Cook is one of the creators behind YouTube account, Classified Goons, which has more than 39,600 subscribers. In his prank videos he does things like impersonate an employee at a Target where he doesn’t actually work, and pretend to throw up inside ride share vehicles while recording peoples’ reactions to the hijinks. Many of his videos feature people visibly upset by the fact that they’re being filmed. Most of the posted videos have tens of thousands of views. The most popular has over 430,000.

Original Post Below:

Donald Trump, founder and former board chairman of Truth Social parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has been arrested and arraigned in New York City. The tech pioneer turned himself into police custody around 1:30 P.M. ET after weeks of whispers surrounding if and when he would be indicted and arraigned for charges related to an alleged hush money payout to adult film star, Stormy Daniels.


Trump wrote on his social network, “Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse. Seems so SURREAL—WOW, they are going to ARREST ME. Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!” Earlier in the day on Truth Social, he lambasted so-called RINOs—Republicans in name only—and Democrats.

Though the exact charges aren’t yet known, as the indictment is sealed, the suspected $130,000 payment in question came during the final weeks of the media mogul’s widely discussed, contentious 2016 political campaign. Daniels was set to sell her story of an affair with Trump to a tabloid, when fixer Michael Cohen intervened with the payment.

More than 24 charges are set to be on the docket, per the New York Times. The charges are set to be listed soon, once the tech founder is arraigned in his first-ever criminal court appearance as a defendant.

Trump traveled to New York on Monday from his home at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in order to face the new charges at the Manhattan courthouse. The Florida man departed Trump Tower—the landmark mixed-use skyscraper, where he also has a residence—around 1:07 P.M. ET to head to surrender himself at the district attorney’s office, where he arrived less than a half hour later.

Hundreds of members of the media, security, and scattered small groups of protestors were gathered at outside Trump Tower in a crowd that stretched around the block, as the tech founder was led by an entourage into a car flanked by vehicles in a motorcade. He was not handcuffed and appeared defiant, exiting the building with a raised fist.

Trump’s been exceedingly vocal “truthing” on his social platform in the lead-up to Tuesday’s arrest. He previously called the ordeal a “kangaroo court” and claimed the judge and his family are “well known Trump haters.”

Prior to starting his own social media brand, Trump was a mediocre real-estate and business investor who managed to attain peak-influencer status. He has attracted massive followings across mainstay platforms like Twitter and Facebook with his unique blend of @dril-style unhinged comedy and via fueling real-world political acts of violence. Currently, he has more than 87.3 million Twitter followers. On Facebook, he has 34 million.


ADVERTISEMENT

Yet in 2021, after he seemed to stoke an attempted insurrection on the U.S. Capitol, most major social media sites enacted two-year bans against Trump, shutting his accounts down. In response, he wasn’t deterred. Instead, the maverick media man was inspired to start TMTG and Truth Social. He was chairman of the company’s board for about a year before his removal in July 2022 amid the start of a federal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.

Though he’s hasn’t been officially involved in the TMTG board for months now, Trump remains active on the platform he founded. He posts there frequently on a wide array of topics—including his own legal troubles—in part thanks to a semi-exclusive contract that requires him to default to the site over others.

ADVERTISEMENT

On the site he founded, Trump has about 5.07 million followers—far less than elsewhere. But, if you look at it upside-down, audience curation could be viewed as part of Truth social’s strong suit. Despite a stated goal of reaching 81 million active accounts, the site only has about 5 million members at the moment (yes, all of them follow Trump). The platform and parent company TMTG seem to be going for user depth over reach—aiming to reach total saturation of the biggest dipshits on the internet, terrible advertisements, bots, and everybody’s one uncle.

Somehow, despite Truth Social’s unique branding strategy, the platform has faced financial and legal trouble over the past year. So far, small-time billionaire Trump has lost about 17% of his personal wealth as Truth Social has struggled. His fortune has dropped some $550 million as of Tuesday because of TMTG’s ongoing devaluation, according to a report from Forbes.

It’s unclear how Trump’s arrest will impact the social media brand and wider company. Gizmodo reached out to TMTG for comment and did not receive a response as of publication time.

4/3/2023,"Yes, Tinder Is Working on a $500 Subscription Tentatively Called 'Tinder Vault'","Tinder has struggled to move away from its identity as a hook-up app as parent company Match Group talked up ‘premium subscription features.’
Photo: Lauren DeCicca (Getty Images)

Tinder is working on an ultra-expensive subscription offering that seems explicitly geared toward those wealthy enough (or at those feigning affluence) looking to swipe right on other semi-influential folks. The company is leaving the door open to abandon the idea altogether, meaning that those with deep pockets would be left swiping left on the riff-raff like the rest of us base commoners.

A Monday a Fast Company report citing Tinder Chief Product Officer Mark Van Ryswyk confirms the company is still testing out the $500-a-month subscription called “Tinder Vault.” Such a subscription would make them known to the pool of people who are also willing to pay. The feature is still in early stages and the company is leaving itself room to change the name, price, or any other aspect of this potential offering.

ADVERTISEMENT

There’s been murmurings of an even more expensive subscription than Tinder’s $30 a month Platinum subscription. In February, Reddit user SmithMano posted screenshots of what appears to be a Tinder promotion for “Tinder VAULT.” Users who pay $500 a month or $5,000 a year get a “special status” and a “priority pass” that seems to imply even more profile boosts than the other Tinder subscription tiers. Other than priority in other users’ feeds, the proposed services include a “personalized concierge service” that would act as a kind of pick-up artist 24/7 advice service. There’s also a “premium passport” perk that would give users access to its “most active and influential members.”

Whatever ends up happening with Vault, Van Ryswk told Fast Company that the new feature would be an extension of Tinder’s current features, and seemed to imply that real-life human matchmakers may not make it into the final product.

Such a “Tinder, but for rich people” is not completely out of the wheelhouse for Tinder owner Match Group. The dating app conglomerate owns a huge number of dating apps including Hinge and OkCupid, and last year it purchased dating platform The League. That app comes with some pretty pricey access options and the app is described as “high-powered (and empowered) people who are ready for a long-term relationship.”

Van Ryswyk said that The League subscribers have remained steady despite all those layoffs in high-paying industries like tech, so it seems the company is still bullish on the Vault concept to some extent. Tinder has been on a kind of existential journey of self discovery since last year after the company’s previous CEO Renate Nyborg announced she was leaving Tinder. Tinder is starting to look more like Hinge recently as it tries to get away from the image that Tinder is only for hook-ups.

ADVERTISEMENT

Last year Match Group reported its total revenue declined by 2% compared to the same time in 2021, though company CEO Bernard Kim mentioned they expected to launch a “bold new marketing campaign” for the world’s most popular dating app in 2023. Alongside expanded discovery features, their product roadmap mentions “premium subscription features” and “premium discovery preferences” under the category of “broadening monetization.”",https://gizmodo.com/tinder-dating-app-tinder-vault-hinge-bumble-1850295751
4/3/2023,Pro-Putin Blogger Handed Bust of Himself Before Explosion Killed Him,"Photo: AP News (AP)

A Russian pro-Kremlin blogger who was known for his support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was killed in an explosion on Sunday that authorities believe was inside a gift. Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name is Maksim Fomin, was speaking at a cafe in St. Petersburg for the pro-war group Cyber Front Z when witnesses say they saw a woman give Tatarsky a small look-alike statue before moving to the back of the room.

“This woman sat at our table. I saw her from the back as she was turned away. When she gifted him the figurine, she went to sit in a different place by the window and forgot her phone at our table,” one witness told Russian state-owned domestic news agency RIA Novosti. The witness added, “The host at the stage took the figurine from the box and showcased it, Vladlen held it for a bit. They put it back and shortly after the explosion happened… I was running and my ears were blocked. There were many people with blood on them.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Russia’s Interior Ministry said on Monday that they identified Daria Trepova as a suspect in Tatarsky’s murder after several eyewitnesses claimed the explosion went off after he received the figurine. Fontanka, a local news outlet reported that according to a witness, a woman introduced herself to Tatarsky as Nastya, a sculptor. Another witness told the local tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda that Tatarsky asked the woman to bring it to him after she said she wasn’t permitted to bring the statue inside because of bombing fears, The New York Times reported.

Gizmodo was unable to independently verify the above claims.

Tatarsky was a radical supporter of the invasion of Ukraine and gained prominence after he attended a ceremony marking Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal claims of the annexation of four regions of Ukraine. At the time of his death, Tatarsky had more than half a million followers on his Telegram blog where he expressed criticism of any Russian setbacks in the war, citing flaws in Russia’s army.

The Cyber Front Z pro-war group expressed their condolences to the victims and their families in a post on Sunday, CNN reported. The group wrote, “During our regular event in a cafe we rented, there was a terrorist attack. We took certain security measures, but, unfortunately, they were not enough.”

The Russian Investigative Committee for St. Petersburg opened a murder investigation and is trying to piece together what happened leading up to the explosion. According to CNN, at least 32 people were injured when the blast went off including ten people who are in serious condition.

Cyber Front Z added in the blog post, “Separate condolences to everyone who knew the wonderful war correspondent and our good friend Vladlen Tatarsky. Now we are cooperating with law enforcement agencies and we hope that all those responsible will be punished.”",https://gizmodo.com/russia-ukraine-vladlen-tatarsky-kremlin-putin-1850295311
4/3/2023,"Au Revoir, Electric Scooters: Paris Votes to Ban E-Scooter Rentals","Rental e-scooters, once heralded in Paris, France as a potential way to boost the city’s climate efforts, are set to be banned following a referendum.

E-scooters are set to make a final French exit from the City of Lights. Residents of Paris, France have overwhelmingly voted to ban the electric micro mobility rentals in a Sunday referendum.


Turn-out was low: Just 103,084 people (about 7.5% of registered voters) showed up to weigh in. But among that subset, electric scooters proved profoundly unpopular. More than 89% of people cast their ballots against the continuation of self-service e-scooter rentals, according to results posted to the city’s website.

ADVERTISEMENT

The vote doesn’t impact privately owned, personal scooters nor e-bikes, but does hurt the three self-service scooter rental companies operating in the French city: Lime, Dott, and Tier whose e-scooters have proliferated around Paris in recent years. There, as in many metropolitan areas around the world, the battery-powered micro mobility devices have stirred controversy and introduced some novel city-planning and regulatory conundrums since their arrival.

In 2022, 34 people died in France while riding e-scooters or similar devices, according to the country’s national road safety department. The agency also noted that over that same time period, 570 others had been seriously injured in e-scooter or micro mobility accidents. These injuries and deaths have risen precipitously from about zero in 2018, to the present-day stats, per the safety department, despite regulatory efforts to boost scooter safety.

In 2019, a law passed requiring e-scooter riders wear high visibility clothing, mandated that they ride with the flow of traffic, and introduced hefty fines for speed limit violations, according to the BBC. Still though, the human toll has continued to rise.

In addition to the safety issues, opponents of the devices also commonly point out that their dockless nature leads to scooter-clogged sidewalks, public spaces, and roadway hazards. Often, e-scooters have ended up polluting parks or even the bottom of waterways (like Paris’s Seine), where they’re dumped. Paris previously instituted fines for riding and improperly parking e-scooters on sidewalks, but again that seemed to do little to address the issue, per the BBC.

ADVERTISEMENT

Often proponents of e-scooters argue they are a more environmentally friendly means of transport than cars and other gas-powered vehicles. They’ve also been touted as a way to improve transit connectivity and transportation accessibility. However, these arguments may not hold as much water in Paris, which is generally walkable and already has extensive, high quality public transit that people use.

A recent city-sponsored study showed that, without e-scooters, people would most often default to traveling via another type of low-carbon transportation like biking, walking, or hopping on the metro, according to the New York Times.

ADVERTISEMENT

Though this weekend’s vote is technically non-binding, per another New York Times report, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she intends to abide by public opinion. “This evening, the Parisians who spoke overwhelmingly spoke out against self-service scooters,” Hidalgo said in the city’s press statement. “Their very clear message now becomes our roadmap. With my team, we will follow through on their decision as I promised.” The mayor has been a recent leader in the push against the rental scooters, and has previously described them as a “nuisance,” according to NYT.

Scooter operators’ contracts expire at the end of August in Paris, and they won’t be renewed. Beginning September 1, “there will be no more self-service scooters in Paris,” Hidalgo said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Though many European cities have embraced e-scooters as yet another means of transit, the tides of opinion and policy have seemingly begun to shift. Earlier this year, Barcelona temporarily banned bringing e-scooters onto public transportation following an incident where one of the vehicles burst into flames on a local train in 2022. Paris’ new ballot measure could set a precedent elsewhere among major European tourist destinations.

In one notorious 2022 incident in Rome, Italy, a pair of American tourists managed to deal €25,000 in damage to the city’s Spanish steps, a historical and cultural site in the Rome’s old center.",https://gizmodo.com/e-scooter-electric-scooter-paris-lime-dott-tier-1850293357
4/3/2023,The Chinese Spy Balloon Captured Sensitive Military Info After All,"Image: Handout (Getty Images)

U.S. officials confirmed on Monday that the Chinese spy balloon that flew over the U.S. in February transmitted sensitive military information to China in real time. The Chinese government continues to claim it was a weather balloon that had blown off course.

Two senior U.S. officials and one former senior administration official told NBC News that the balloon collected electronic signals as it flew over multiple military sites, sometimes flying in figure-eight formations. The electronic signals can be transmitted from weapons systems or obtained through communications from base personnel before it was shot down on February 4, officials said.

ADVERTISEMENT

The balloon first entered U.S. airspace as it flew over Alaska on January 28 before making its way through Canada and re-entering the U.S. over Montana. President Joe Biden eventually gave the go-ahead to shoot down the spy balloon, which was the size of three school buses when it was over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina. After receiving backlash for not shooting it down earlier, Biden said at the time that he was waiting to take the balloon down until it would not pose a risk to civilians on the ground.

A senior defense official said at a press briefing in February, “The PRC has claimed publicly that the high-altitude balloon operating above the United States is a weather balloon that was blown off-course. This is false.” He continued, “This was a PRC surveillance balloon. This surveillance balloon purposefully traversed the United States and Canada. And we are confident it was seeking to monitor sensitive military sites. Its route over the United States, near many potential sensitive sites, contradicts the PRC government’s explanation that it was a weather balloon.”

Officials told CNN they knew the direction the balloon was taking and could proactively shut down its military communication systems to censor signals on the bases before the balloon could access them. Meanwhile, China has repeatedly denied obtaining any surveillance information, saying the U.S. overreacted, but officials are still looking into which company, department, or organization was responsible for the balloon, NBC reported.

The remains of the balloon were collected by the U.S. Navy and are still being examined by the FBI, but little information has been gleaned from the debris. CNN reported the FBI is still trying to determine what algorithm was used for the balloon’s software, how it worked, and how it was powered and designed.

After the balloon was shot down, Biden said the balloon was “not a major breach,” The Guardian reported, but added, “It’s a violation of international law. It’s our airspace. And once it comes into our space, we can do what we want with it.” ",https://gizmodo.com/china-spy-balloon-military-bases-chinese-1850293627
4/3/2023,Elon Musk Makes It Harder to Distinguish Between Blue Verified and Paid Checkmarks to Save Face,"Image: Rokas Tenys (Shutterstock)

After sparking a heated debate for saying he would take legacy blue checkmarks away from verified accounts beginning on April 1 if those users didn’t pay $8 for Twitter Blue, Twitter CEO Elon Musk backed away from his threat. To save face, though, Musk has simply made it harder to tell the difference between verified accounts and Twitter Blue subscribers.

“This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account,” reads a new message when you hover over someone’s blue checkmark. The message replaced an earlier notice that said: “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.”

ADVERTISEMENT

When followers asked him about the new message, Musk simply responded with “😌,” the relieved face emoji.

People ranging from celebrities to reporters that were given blue checkmarks by Twitter’s previous management, which verified noteworthy accounts and ensured people were actually who they claimed to be, spent last Friday bidding adieu to their checkmarks and stating they would not pay the company $8 to keep them. However, April 1 came and went, and the blue checkmarks largely remained. (One exception was the official New York Times Twitter account, whose checkmark Musk removed after one of his followers pointed out the news outlet proclaimed it wouldn’t pay.)

ADVERTISEMENT

Questions ensued. Was it possible that Twitter simply didn’t know how to remove the blue checkmarks? According to the Washington Post, Twitter’s previous verification process was done manually, with employees keeping track of verified accounts on an internal spreadsheet. The Post reported that in the past, there was no way to reliably remove blue checkmarks en masse, which forced workers to remove them one-by-one. Sometimes, even that didn’t work.

It’s also possible that Musk finally realized what many users with legacy blue checks had told him: People with legacy blue checkmarks are Twitter’s lifeblood. And many were not happy about being told to pay up.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Hey @elonmusk what’s this about blue checks going away unless we pay Twitter? I’ve been here for 15 years giving my ⏰ & witty thoughts all for bupkis. Now you’re telling me that I have to pay for something you gave me for free? What is this-the Colombia Records & Tape Club?🙄” Star Trek actor William Shatner tweeted at Musk on March 25.

ADVERTISEMENT

LeBron James was another celebrity who made heads turn when he tweeted goodbye to his blue checkmark on March 31.

“Welp guess my blue ✔️ will be gone soon cause if you know me I ain’t paying the 5. 🤷🏾‍♂️”

ADVERTISEMENT

Current and former Twitter employees also warned Musk about the importance of blue checkmarks. Nathan Hubbard, who once served as Twitter’s vice president of global commerce and media, tweeted that part of the fun of Twitter was that users knew that they were interacting with and sharing their thoughts with real thought leaders. Hubbard also warned of the danger of asking Twitter’s most important creators to pay Twitter instead of the other way around.

ADVERTISEMENT

“If most OG blue checks stop tweeting in protest of being asked to pay to create the content that Twitter lives by…Twitter dies,” he said, adding: “The likely sequencing will be like LeBron: first, give up the check and not pay. But as the experience degrades and impersonation abounds, creators will start to wonder why they’d contribute content to a platform and company that holds them in such contempt.”

In the end, whatever the reason, noteworthy accounts that were verified remained verified, although whether that check will remain is as murky as ever.",https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-twitter-blue-verified-checkmarks-still-there-1850293206
4/1/2023,7 Other Times the U.S. Stupidly Tried to Ban TikTok,"Photo: Samuel Corum (AP)

U.S. government efforts to ban TikTok over national security grounds, once considered a pie-in-the-sky pipe dream, are looking more and more likely by the week, especially after Congress browbeat TikTok’s CEO for five hours last week. That said, we’ve been here before. Various players in the federal government have attempted to ban TikTok before, all unsuccessfully.

In just three short months, at least four new bills have reached the House and Senate demanding, in various forms, a national ban of the Chinese-owned app. TikTok is already banned on all federal government devices. More and more states have passed laws doing the same thing on a local level. These new sets of bill would take things much further, however, and essentially excise an app TikTok says is currently used by 150 million Americans—one in two people in the nation. That backlash to such a ban is difficult to imagine.

Though support for the bans has increased, the rationale behind it remains as obtuse as ever. Lawmakers and officials, for years now, have warned the Chinese government could sneakily use TikTok to harvest US users’ data which they say could harm national security. “Could” and “Might” are the keywords here. To date, the US government has yet to provide any concrete evidence backing these claims.

That said, TikTok definitely hasn’t done itself any favors. The Department of Justice is currently investigating TikTok over claims it spied on three former BuzzFeed reporters in the company’s investigation of an internal leak. Former employee whistleblowers, meanwhile, have said TikTok’s plans to secure US user data in Oracle servers simply don’t go far enough, with one saying only a “complete re-engineering” of the app would be necessary to meet lawmakers’ demands. Another former employee, writing in a letter sent to ByteDance by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley’s office, alleged TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance are “functionally the same company.”

So here we are, with a national TikTok ban or forced sale looking all the more likely. Below are all of these legislative efforts so far vying to make that a reality.",https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-ban-7-times-us-tried-to-ban-tiktok-1850289910

Fox News will be forced to defend its promotion of the “Big Lie” in court, as a Delaware judge ruled that a jury would need to decide whether there was “actual malice” in how the network let election disinformation loose upon its millions of viewers.


On Friday, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled that Dominion Voting Systems has not yet proved Fox acted with libelous intent by promoting the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. At the same time, the judge ruled against Fox News and Fox Corporation’s attempts to quash the lawsuit. He further gave Dominion the benefit that Fox’s statements, by themselves, could constitute defamation.

ADVERTISEMENT

Dominion kicked up the hornet’s nest when it brought its $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News back in 2021. The company has said it’s seeking recompense for lost profits due to the lies spread about the company. Dominion has filed similar lawsuits against ultra-conservative networks like Newsmax and OAN.

Davis wrote that Dominion has met the burden of proof to show that all of Fox’s promoted statements about the voting machine company were all lies. The judge added the evidence is “CRYSTAL clear [emphasis his] that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.” A trial is set to start sometime in April.


The court held two hearings earlier this week to discuss the matter. In its summary judgment request, Fox News has tried to argue that its promotion of the big lie was just common journalist practice by discussing the election allegations coming from Trump. The network further claimed its reporting was protected under the First Amendment, and that there’s precedent protecting news sites from allegations later proven false.

On the flip side, Dominion argued Fox was actively promoting the big lie by publishing and promoting top election deniers.

ADVERTISEMENT

Defamation suits like this hang on the thin thread of proving that one side had “actual malice” in its speech, meaning it acted knowing the information was false or acting with reckless disregard to a statement’s truth. It’s an incredibly hard burden of proof for plaintiffs in defamation cases, though at least Dominion has a lot of ammunition to fire at Fox, mostly from hosts’ and guests’ own lips.

The document retreads much of what came out in texts and emails from Fox executives and hosts. The main faces at Fox News regularly complained about Trump and the election conspiracy, calling it “shockingly reckless” and complaining about election conspiracists like Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani. In records from Fox Corporation Chair Rupert Murdoch’s deposition, the venerable scion of conservative media around the globe said he could have stopped Fox News from bringing on the election conspiracists, but chose not to.",https://gizmodo.com/fox-news-big-lie-trump-dominion-1850289625

After nearly a decade of courtroom arguments and appeals, one California man is finally emerging victorious in a protracted legal fight against Grubhub.

Raef Lawson, a former Grubhub driver and aspiring actor/comedian/writer, has won his case against the company. His complaint, first filed in 2015, is one big step closer to being settled. And for all those years of hearings, filings, and briefings Lawson’s triumph has, so far, netted him an astounding...$65 payout.

ADVERTISEMENT

More important than the financial outcome here, though, is the legal precedent the case sets. The ruling could have big implications for how “gig economy” companies like Grubhub, Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have to treat their workers in the California.

Lawson’s case hinges on whether he was a contractor in his brief four month stint delivering food for Grubhub, or an employee—entitled to minimum wage, overtime, and other benefits. An initial 2018 ruling sided with the company, and denied Lawson employee status. But after an appeal to the Ninth Circuit and a remand back down to the same district court, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley has now ruled that, under California laws, Lawson was legally a Grubhub employee during his time as a delivery driver.

“Mr. Lawson is properly classified as an employee, not an independent contractor, for purposes of his minimum wage and overtime claims,” wrote Judge Corley. “He is entitled to judgment on his minimum wage claim (count two of the complaint) with damages in the amount of $65.11,” the order adds. That $65.11 makes up for sub-minimum wages that Lawson was paid by Grubhub. The plaintiff wasn’t awarded any overtime, as the court ruled his compensable time worked never exceeded 4o hours in a week. Still, 65 bucks isn’t too shabby when it comes with employee status.


Employees have many more rights than independent contractors and are legally guaranteed many more benefits from their employers like overtime and access to unemployment insurance. Gig workers have been fighting to be recognized as employees for years now, and in places like California they may be beginning to make headway. Between Judge Corley’s first and last rulings in Lawson’s case, the state law changed. AB5, a landmark piece of legislation, passed in 2019—thus setting stricter standards protecting workers and instituting a new set of criteria for what is/isn’t an employee.

ADVERTISEMENT

It’s on these recently instituted criteria that Thursday’s ruling is based. Corley decided that the Grubhub/Lawson relationship didn’t satisfy the so-called ABC test for contract work and that Grubhub wasn’t eligible for a business-to-business exception to the ABCs. Under the test, a worker can only be considered a contractor if they meet three requirements:

The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact;
The worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business; and
The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed.
ADVERTISEMENT

Obviously, delivering food for Grubhub does relate to the company’s main business. After all, that is Grubhub’s entire business. The judge agreed. “The usual course of its business is connecting restaurants with diners to facilitate food ordering. Food delivery is not outside the usual course of that business,” ruled Corley. “Because Grubhub has not established Prong B, it does not meet the ABC test and Mr. Lawson is properly classified as an employee for purposes of his minimum wage and overtime claims.”

And though the question of “employee or contractor” is settled for Lawson—the case isn’t quite over yet. The suit is a Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) case, meaning it seeks to recover penalties on behalf of the plaintiff and others in the same group (i.e. Grubhub drivers) who were subject to labor code violations in California, explained Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer representing Lawson, to Gizmodo in an email.

“The first stage was for him to prove he was an employee (which we did, at last, after 8 years of litigation!),” wrote Liss-Riordan. “I am looking forward to the next stage of the case, which will be to collect penalties for GrubHub’s misclassification of drivers across California for years,” she added

ADVERTISEMENT

Per Liss-Riordan, Lawson’s $65 win may be the first court ruling in the U.S. to deem a gig worker an employee for wage purposes. “It is an important precedent,” she said.

However, the reach of that precedent is a little unclear given that Proposition 22 is still winding its way through California’s courts. The law, passed as a ballot measure in 2020, would essentially make gig worker companies exempt from abiding by AB5. Prop 22 was recently upheld in a state court of appeals, after a lower court had deemed it unconstitutional. Another appeal is expected, which would push the case up to the state’s Supreme Court.

“Given Prop 22, the [awarded] penalties could likely at this point only go up until December 2020. But there are still several years of penalties available, so the cost to GrubHub in this case could be substantial,” clarified Liss-Riordan. “It remains to be seen still whether the California Supreme Court will take up the constitutionality challenge to Prop 22,” she added.

ADVERTISEMENT

The question of how companies built on the backs of gig workers have to categorize those drivers/couriers/Task Rabbits/etc... is a long-standing one that multiple states, not just California, have been grappling with. Last year, Massachusetts’ Supreme Court ruled against a ballot measure that would’ve designated all gig workers as independent contractors. Other states, like Georgia, Alabama, and Florida have favored the corporations.

Yet those state decisions could become moot if Biden’s Department of Labor successfully institutes a proposed federal rule guaranteeing gig workers employee status. Rideshare and delivery companies have come out in strong opposition to the rule. Most recently, Uber and Lyft’s trade group have publicly questioned the merit of Biden’s recent DOL nominee as the companies attempt to undermine worker rights.

Block, the Jack Dorsey-owned parent company of Cash App, is contesting accusations of fraud and rampant fake accounts with a new data disclosure. In a Thursday memo to investors, the company claimed that 44 million of Cash App’s total 52 million active monthly accounts have been authenticated via its “Identity Verification (IDV) program.”


Further, the company stated that about 39 million of those users represent “unique Social Security numbers as of December 2022.” Assuming that means that, minimum, 39 million users are real people with real U.S.-issued SSNs, then the newly released data runs counter to known short-seller Hindenberg’s claims from last week.

On March 23, the investment research firm released a report alleging that between 40% and 75% of Cash App users are “fake, involved in fraud” or that the numbers were simply the result of users holding multiple accounts. Block denied the accusations in a public blogpost, and said it would “explore legal action” against Hindenberg. Nonetheless, following the short seller’s report, Block’s stock value nosedived by more than 20%, according to Bloomberg Markets. 

In response, Dorsey’s company was apparently compelled to release more details on its user base. In addition to the numbers on verified users, Block also addressed transaction specifics. It estimates the overwhelming majority of incoming transfers—some 97%—are from verified account activity, per the memo. Though, it’s unclear how the company got to that estimation.

Cash App is only available to users in the U.S. and United Kingdom. The company allows individuals to hold multiple different accounts, but says that’s a feature, not a bug. “Cash App is built to support customers who may want to maintain multiple accounts. For example, customers can maintain a separate business and personal account or can also maintain multiple personal accounts (e.g., one for everyday personal use and one to set aside funds for budgeting),” the company noted in the Thursday memo.

It further claims that its “approach to compliance is consistent with other financial services platforms.”

3/30/2023,The Hoverboards Are Still Exploding,"Hoverboards were a staple of mid-2010's Internet pop culture.

The infamous two-wheeled motorized scooters colloquially known as “hoverboards” are still proving dangerous almost a decade after their peak. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued a recall of a hoverboard from Jetson Electric Bikes after two deaths were reported.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s recall was announced today, specifically for the 42-volt Rogue self-balancing hoverboard from Jetson Electric Bikes, which were manufactured between 2018 and 2019. The scooters were sold at Target stores between 2018 and 2019 and on the Jetson website from 2019 to 2021. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says that consumers should stop using the hoverboards immediately and contact Jetson for a full refund.

According to the recall, the lithium-ion battery that powers the hoverboard is prone to overheating, presenting a fire hazard to those that zoom around on it. The Commission is recalling around 53,000 units of the scooters. The recall comes after a 10-year-old girl and her 15-year-old sister died from a fire in April 2022, of which the Hellertown Borough Fire Marshal determined the scooter was the point of origin according to the CPSC’s release.

“There have been multiple other reports of the recalled scooters/hoverboards burning, sparking or melting, several of which involved reports of flames,” the Consumer Product Safety Commission wrote in its recall. “CPSC and Jetson are urging consumers to immediately stop using and stop charging the recalled 42-volt version of the self-balancing scooters/hoverboards and contact Jetson for a full refund.”

Hoverboards such as the one from Jetson were a staple of mid-2010's Internet pop culture, popularized by video-sharing apps and creators like Casey Neistat. However, hoverboards have been consistent in their propensity to self-ignite, with bans across the world and some recalls beginning as early as 2016. 93,000 of the non-hovering hoverboards were recalled less than a year ago.",https://gizmodo.com/hoverboard-recall-jetson-electric-bikes-1850284842
